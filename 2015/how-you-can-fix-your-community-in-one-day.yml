Okay, so we're just prepping our last talk for today. And I know we've
all been very organized getting back into the room on time, we're now
back after Thilo's talk. We've learned a lot of exciting things that
are happening in JRuby get a plan for it and for the cool tools that
are coming out.  ‑‑ this talk is thee maltically different but
extremely relevant to a topic in our industry which is not only making
it a really inclusive welcoming place for newcomers, but making it the
sort of place that people want to stay for. So, yeah, Anika is going
to talk a little bit about that theme.


Yeah, so Anika if you have not yet met her works at Travsti she was
employee number 6. And she is running the Travis foundation. She's
very involved with the Rails Girls Summer of Code, which me and Sarah
are also very involved in. Which is a 3 month program to get women
into Open Source. Started on July 1st and running till the end of
September. And yeah, and it's generally just an activist for ‑‑ to get
more diversity, not just Open Source, but into the world of tech.


Sitting in the front row. Hiding. Hiding behind his Hoodie. Yeah, so
with other actually really grateful for to Toby and Luka for giving
us ‑‑ giving us the possibility to talk about this topic which is
really close to our hearts. So, he's ‑‑ please give a huge round of
applause Anika Lind thener which will give you a little magic trick to
help your community one day (Applause).


Thank you. A couple movants ago this picture became my favorite
picture in the whole world and ‑‑ his Thomas ‑‑ two white programmers
holding a sign that says the world will be better when IT becomes less
boring than this. And they shared this picture on Twitter under the
Hashtag donate because to animate people to donate ‑‑ to is support
our crowd funding campaign N the next minutes I'm going to tell you
why this picture is so wonderful. Why they are so right and how we can
can make a community that actually looks like this. Into a community
that looks that. Magic. Hi. I'm Anika. I'm really happy to be invited
on this stage to talk to you and I'm going to share with you the magic
trick on how to fix your community in one day. I'm going to talk to
you about what diversity is. What use it is to us. Why we need it and
how we can achieve it because diversity is achievable. And to
understand what's going on we need to take a look at the field of
technology and engineering in general to understand the issues and the
problems and the roots of the problems that we are faced with in our
communities. So our world is as diverse as some tech companies and
conferences can only wish for. We are surrounded by different age
groups and genders, cultural and religious backgrounds, ethnicity, job
level, sexual preferences etc.. In this talk I'm mostly going focus on
gender and I'm mostly going to talk about women since that's my
expertise. But for a second let's actually look like what diversity
would actually look like:. It's not one pink bubble and a lot of blue
ones or the other way around, it's when you can see what the
dominating group ‑‑ when you can't see what the dominating group is
anymore because there isn't one. And not everyone belongs to just one
category, but belongs to many. And did you know that only ten percent
of the world's population are white and male, but most of the people
creating the software which we use all over the world, every day are
white and male so if we have non‑diverse teams developing software
it's because of a social imbalance. We solve the problems that we
see. And people from the same background in a team will come up with
the same ideas and solution. On the other handy verse teams or teams
with people from different backgrounds and experiences are more
creative, innovative, and more productive than non‑diverse teams which
has been shown by huge number of studies so this means that diversity
is a key ingredient to building a strong community and a business that
is built to last. And even financially it shows that companies that
include many women in senior positions show better financial results
than companies who include fewer, actually no women in senior
positions. A diverse team can also capture a greater share of the
consumer market because it has been proven that teams with people from
different backgrounds can, of course, more effectively market to
consumers from different back go gunneds. A good example for a diverse
team is actually the closed captioning feature of YouTube video which
was a huge win for Google and had a big impact on their consumer
market. So the story is when the internet was invented it was awesome
for deaf people because it was all in writing. And they could
understand everything. But then videos kept turning up, which they
couldn't understand anymore so they were left out. So the deafening
near Ken Erhi insten released and pushed for the close captioning of
YouTube videos. This little sign the CC sign that you can lick, you
can turn on and off the subtitles or captioning for the videos. This
feature had a hugh business impact beyond the community of the deaf
and well beyond what was anticipated. So now people from all over the
world can make their videos accessible for a super huge audience and
users can understand videos that are not in their mother tongue,
thanks to this feature. So the world including the deaf community can
now connect even further, and Google has proved it's importance on the
market once more. And at this point I had prepared an example for this
talk, but spoiler alert it has now kind of a happy ending, I'm talking
about Apples health kit included in the Apple watch. When they
released Apple watch they said in the health kit you can monitor all
the matrix that you're most interested in. Oh, well you can monitor
everything up to your sodium intake, but just not your period,
something that women have been tracking for centuries that is "the"
health related issue women are concerned with every day. But, I'm
happy to report only two weeks after I gave the talk in May, Apple
announced with iOS 9 it will finally include a period tracker. So they
do listen. Yeah, jokes aside, but I'm really happy they came to their
senses, the Apple watch is still kind of bad, sad, great example for
this because there's also the news that people with dark skin or
tattoose toos on their wrist may have problems with the watch. The
light sensors that the watch uses to monitor pulse etc. may not work
correctly for these people, which is crazy.  I don't know, there's no
other word for it . We can just hope that this actually gets a happy
ending as well as the period tracker feature got. So it could have
been a great product with even more satisfied customers from the
beginning. And these fails happen because the teams that are
developing the software are not diverse. And they're not diverse
because of social injustice. Lena said diversity is the default. If
it's not diverse, it's broken. So if a community is not diverse it's
broken. Let me show you exactly what it means and introduce you to a
programmer who quit her job after fifteen years of being a programmer
Garann Means.  I didn't know how to move forward, things fell down
over the years there was a lot I had to put up with in the culture of
tech, it just didn't seem worth it anymore. So after 15 years of being
a programmer she just quit, so what's happening?  The thing is she is
not the only one. Women are leaving the industry. So let's look at
this a little bit closer. If we look at the path people usually take
in entering tech and we can imagine getting the kind of pipeline
ideally people get in, get around, they enter university, study, get a
job, get promoted etc.. But the study from last year found that half
the women entering the field will at some point leave. 50 percent, so
we have holes in our pipeline which means at this point we are filling
a damaged pipeline which is super frustrating. So why does it leak?
Why do people leave. They leave because of hostile work environment,
they're feeling isolated, lack of career path for them. They're often
overlooked in promotions and we have a lack of role models. The other
thing is that we don't even have many women in the field of
technology, so women hold of all the jobs all over the world they hold
48 percent, so that's basically half of the jobs there are. So it's
quite equal, but they only hold 20 percent of jobs in tech and in Open
Source it's much worse. We only have 11 percent of women. So this is
our problem. Out of the few women that are making it into tech, half
of them are leaving. And one of the barriers that keeps women from
entering the field easily or making it to the top is that the bar is
set so much higher for women and minorities. Research has found in
blind studies that women's work has to be 2.5 times as good as men's
to be considered equal. So this is because of unconscious bias and
stereotypes we have. So let's quickly talk about
that. Stereotypes. We ‑‑ we love the idea that we can perceive
something objectively by looking at it and seeing the truth. But our
truth is actually shaped by biases and stereotypes. There's this
Harvard experiment called implicit. It's a test on bias, which you can
do on‑line, you can find the link with my slides on speaker deck. So
this test they found that everybody, everybody has bias. For example
70‑80 percent have bias against women in tech, even women in tech have
these biases. Or they're preferring white to African American or
preferring young people. But almost nobody reports those biases. This
means everybody has them but nobody thinks they do. Stereotypes. We
learn them through cultural messages, portrayal in the media, comments
from friends and family. And my favorite story about this that I
really liked driving a car.  I think two years ago I got into driving
again,i had to relearn it, of course a little bit shower to react
there was a situation with me and another car and whatever, I didn't
move as fast as I could have, and then this other driver shouts at me
this German thing, which is Frau ... which means in English women at
the wheel monsters. And the fun thing about it was that the other
driver was also a woman (Laughing) which is, I think twisted in so
many ways, but it shows perfectly how engrained these stereotypes that
we have. And it's really not easy to get rid of them. But we can do
it. And one step is for example how we treat our kids. So this is my
little brother and me, we are fixing a little table thing with
screwdrivers and I think we're doing an awesome job (Laughing) and I
can't stress enough how important we are as role models for our kids
and what opportunities we give them. And we should let kids discover
the world without constraining them to role specific behavior or
treating them differently just because of their gender. They are
natural adventurer, and we should let them live in our wonderful world
without constraining them to these behaviors that actually changes
every other century. We should let them be kids, not girls or either
boys. So to summarize. A diverse team is not only a representation of
our world and socially fair, it makes our team more productive, come
up with more creative and innovative solutions, creates an atmosphere
where everybody feels more welcome, people stay longer in their jobs
financial result and greater market share in a wordy versety is
awesome. And achievable. So, great, let's see what we can do to get
it. So when we look at some Open Source projects I think we all will
agree that we will see that some projects we have a commente meanting
culture that is just unhealthy dismissive maintainers or hostile
comments from users who are feeling entitled to bug faces or features
.  Both sides have a problem. If we are dismisssive about the
contributions we get especially from newcomers, we set the tone with
that and create with that an unwelcoming exclusive culture around our
project. Or if we ‑‑ asousers don't acknowledge that the ‑‑ as users
that the maintainer does the project in his or her own free time and
there's no big company behind this, this can result in draining all
the fun and energy out of the maintainer who more often than not has
to abandon the project because they're gist Freaking burned out. It
starts with improving our community culture. Put a code of conduct on
your side or your read me so everybody knows that abusive, racist,
sexist drum comments are just not ‑‑ discriminating components are not
welcome and there will be consequences. Bring it down to one sentence,
I think it's about having empathy for each other. It's about learning
how to give feedback and how to receive it, creating a good
documentation around our project and treating others with respect and
we have to remember that there's always a human being behind the
code. And this all applies to our on‑line lives as well as our off
line one, it's important to address diversity and inclusiveness each
and every level of our work lives and daily lives. If it's for example
at a work meeting or dinner with family or conference after party. And
here are three steps that I think are important. And first one is
always good to start with yourself.  I really recommend taking the
Harvard test and educate yourself and accept that you do have
bias. And make your bias your unconscious bias conscious. Which means
that then you can counteract them. It also means to question
traditional beliefs and always ask why are we doing it this way. This
helps to dismantle hidden biases and procedures that may produce
barriers for women. We can fix some leak in our broken pipeline by
recognizing women's work. This means make sure women's voices are
being heard and push them forward. Show that you believe in them and
be a monitor for someone and share your expertise. There's a great
example, The Euro camp guides, you should all just go there and sign
up.  I think this is an awesome idea it means that you can sign up to
be a mentor for a newcomer and answer all the questions a newcomer
could have for a conference and show them around a little bit and make
this whole being the first time at a tech conference thing a little
bit easier and more inclusive. Just as a really great example. But as
key as it is, of course for men to support women, it's important for
women to do the same and to connect to others and reach out. Make
yourself visible.  I can get off my couch more often and go to more
user groups, meet ups, conferences.  I can actually make myself
visible in attending. So we should try to be the role model we wished
we had, and I'm not saying it's super easy. It is hard and sometimes
it's really horrible. But, if others are supportive, it's much
easier. And if you ‑‑ you should just take a friend if you don't want
to go alone, that's what I always do. And support others if it's just
with a tiny e‑mail saying hey I really love what you're doing, keep on
doing what you're doing. Inviting her to give a talk. We can reach for
the stars. But we need each other for that. We can't do it alone, we
need support from family, colleagues friends, we can be each other's
support. So let's all, people of all gender let's cause disruption and
break stereotypes. And research shows that we perform worse if we hear
that we're not good at what we do just before we do it. So we should
stop telling women they can't do math and stop telling men that they
can't take care of their kids. We have to break those stereotypes that
are holding us back and words are powerful. We should use ours
wisely. And to show you a case study that implemented all these
things, I will show you how we've built Rails Girls Summer of
Code. Who has heard about it?  Okay, let's just end this
talk. Awesome. It's a three month scholarship program that enables
women to work on Open Source project in every language, not just
Ruby. And it started out as a kind of dream from Rails Girls coaches
and organizers and they wanted to basically give rail girls students a
perspective because after attending the beginning workshop and falling
in love with programming the students are encouraged to start their
own study groups and keep on learning. And now they could keep on
learning towards this goal, this Summer of Code. And the Summer of
Code took the whole Rails Girls movement to the next level in
connecting all the good things that are happening in the Rails Girls
community and keeping the momentum going in companies involved in Open
Source. The concept is that always two students pair up, they will
find local coaches, they will chose an Open Source project.  I think
this year we had 36 projects from which the student could pick from
and they will coordinate with a mentor and then apply for a
scholarship which is full time three months and sponsored. And last
year 162 women applied from all over the world and they came from all
different backgrounds. We had big movie director, photographers, women
that studies human computer interor worked in marketing, but they all
shared the same summer, they were all coding on Open Source
projects. And we are supported by wonderful companies such as GitHub
and Travis CI who are partners together with them and all the other
cool sponsors and many, many awesome human beings, remember this
slide, they actually helped fund more money with this. And there are
many amazing people out there who donated out of their own pocket and
spread the word. In the last two years we could usually sponsor ten
teams each year. And they said the third year, so 2015, it's going to
be the hardest year, super super Einstringen to get the money, but
this year, we raised even more money. One hundred and twenty thousand
US dollars, which means that for the first time ever this year we
could actually fund 16 teams which is super crazy awesome by the
way. But in the program we not only have sponsor teams but also
volunteering ones who didn't get a sponsor seat but said they wanted
to contribute to Open Source no matter what and just kept on coding,
which is super inspiring. And all in all in the last two years we had
32 teams, so 20 sponsors, 14 volunteering that's 64 women in two years
who worked on many different projects. For example these are some of
the projects we've had in the last two years, three years, we've had
speakerinen hoodie, deasor a, but my favorite one (Diaspora.  ) miff
favorite one is speakerinnen. It addressing the issue of few women
speaking at conferences, they can sign up, with their biology gray if
I and the topics they can talk about. Organizers can find future
speakers for their events. To a couple of people. It's still small
project. But we already have over 700 women. So I think we could fill
this room 7 times with women who are saying, here I'm here, I'm
visible, I can talk about these things. And my favorite part is that
this has been filmed by Rails Girl study group in Berlin. And, yes, I
see you coach, there may be some other students here. So this group is
meeting on Monday and because of that they called themselves Ruby
Monday study group, which is you shorten it becomes Ruby monostas. Of
the group was started in 2012 and the group kept on learning after the
first Rails Girls workshop and they built speakerien while learning
how to code. And two of them, two of the Monstas Ana and Kanya who
work directing movies and working in injurialism they made it into the
first edition of Rails Summer of Code. They spoke about their summer
in Kiev. As many teams did all over the world. And with this they
helped spread the word and the Sparke of ‑‑ code. They are now both
working at Travis CI as developer, they submitted speakerinnen as one
of the Open Source projects for this year, they are mentoring the
students during the summer which is where their summer and their story
took on speed. So this is such a dream story that I will never tire of
telling it. It shows what Rails Girls and the Summer of Code actually
made possible. Wait for it. It gets even better. When Carla came up to
me one day, she was writing Blog post about Summer of Code, so that
are the alumni doing right now, do you is any statistics, which we
didn't, so we did go out and ask all the alumni from 2013 and 14 what
they are doing now and we found this. Over 90 percent of our alumni
are now working in tech. And 80 percent of them founded their own
start‑ups even. Which is huge. And it shows even, even more how
important initiatives like Rails ‑‑ Summer of Code are and what impact
we're having. So they are two of the alumni that are now giving back
to the program that changed their lives. And they are highly visible
role models for others to follow south. So to summarize the Rails
Girls Summer of Code we're introducing girls with different
backgrounds ‑‑ introducing friendlinessaround communication and the
culture of the projects and we're helping to fix the leaks in the
pipeline by creating supportive environments for women and boosting
their careers, we even get more women into the pipeline and help
diversify Open Source projects and companies, for example like Travis
CI all in all we created a hands on solution for the lack of women
problem we have in tech communities. Motivate women to start or
continue their careers in tech. So three years ago I joined a rails
the girls workshop to learn about programming. And I was blown away
because the workshop was buzzing with 70 enthusiastic women falling in
love with Ruby on Rails and afterwards I started rails Girls Berlin
with a friend and the community grew like crazy and started study
groups and others followed in Berlin and all over the world. And now
we have this international movement that is Rails Girls in the Summer
of Code which is changing the future of Open Source. And it all ‑‑ it
all comes down to one thing, the magic trick. The magic trick. Is
you. Because initiatives like Rails Girlless Summer of Code is only
possible because so many people are putting in hours of their lives
and coaching, organizing, mentoring, supervising, and it needs people
like you who are giving their time and also it shows what can happen
when they do. So let's remove all the barriers for minorities in Open
Source in tech. Let's build thriving communities put in our love and
support to make some change because this is our community this is our
responsibility. And the end it's really not because statistics and
diversity as a selling factor, in the end we are talking about social
justice. And building the world we want to live in, and we want our
kids to live in. And the good news is that change is possible. And it
only takes us one day. A couple of hours, a study group, a workshop, a
change of mind and heart. One first step. And everybody can do
it. We're all in this together. So let's not waste another second. And
start with it today. Thank you (Applause).
