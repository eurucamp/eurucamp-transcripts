One more fox, all the way in the back. That's the best I can
throw. Warm welcome for Kinsey Ann Durham. (Applause)


Kinsey Ann Durham: Thank you. All right so the title of my talk today
is the struggle to stay in tech. I'm Kinsey Ann Durham, I'm from
Denver, Colorado. Joanne had a lot of awesome pictures of the
mountain, it's this beautiful in person you should come and visit us,
I'm a software helping near at go spot check. We're always hiring. And
a couple years ago I was giving a talk at different Ruby conferences
one in which I met Eric at and talked about breaking down the barriers
to entry and getting more people of diverse backgrounds into tech, but
there's a much bigger issue. We've heard about this in two other talks
and in the co‑documentary if you had the pleasure of seeing that last
night. How p people went to that?  So most of the people in the room,
cool. So to quickly reiterate 56 percent of women end up leaving the
tech industry compared to 17 percent of men. And out of those
56 percent of women, 97 percent of them are never coming back. So it's
awesome we have some awesome organizations that are working really
hard, really hard to get more women and minorities into tech, here's
some of them, I learned a couple more in the documentary last night,
compared to the organizations what are working on keeping women in the
industry, very few. So during my research I decided to screen shot
articles about women leaving the tech industry. Three years ago when I
was first getting introduced to programming and the tech industry I
would have been so discouraged after reading these. And documentary
yesterday one of the women in the video talked about how she feels
guilt about encouraging women to get into tech because sometimes it's
not the best place to be. So yesterday Leslie mentioned the issue of
the leaky pipe and I'm using the same analogy calling it a leaky
bucket mostly because that's what I could find on Google. We have
this ‑‑ over half of the women that successfully break the beariers to
entry end up leaving. So I was curious why. Why are women packing
their bags and leaving?  So I did a bunch offerer of both on‑line and
I also got to interview so much really awesome ladies in the Ruby
community to understand why. So I will dive into you know the reasons
that I found through all my research.  I refer to them as trends. The
first trend I found is a lack of flexibility. Lack of progressive
maternity leave policies, but it's better here, Germany gets 14 weeks
of paid maternity leave, so I realize it's a lot better than US, we
have very bad policies. But I think it's important to mention because
ultimately that isn't the reason why women are leaving, many women
cited inflexible work schedules as the reason they left. Tech
industries, especially start‑ups are notorious for maintaining crave
simpler work hours, this affects both genders, but family
responsibilities usually fall on women. We're stuck in our gender
specific roles even to this day. Men more often than not don't have
the same issue of choosing between a family and a career in tech. And
if they chose family it's really hard to come back, especially in tech
because things are moving so fast by the time they came back there
would be ten new JavaScript frameworks they would have to learn. So
women are still getting more maternity paid leave than fathers do. My
company one time told me we have really progressive maternity leave
policy.  I asked what it was 3 months paid, that's awesome for the US,
when I asked how many weeks fathers get, they said two, I don't think
that's progressive because we're still reinforcing those gender
stereotypes. So flexible scheduling is essential for retaining women
who often face unique work‑life challenges. The second trend that I
found was biased evaluations. They kept, they just kept asking me to
prove myself over and over again. Like now ... when people ask me what
I'm talking about allot conferences often I feel embarrassed oh,
keeping women in tech, I feel like I should be giving a technical
talk, but this is what I feel passionate about it shouldn't make Mimi
feel less of an engineer, but I feel had way sometimes. A study of
performance review in fortune magazine from 28 companies all over the
world with 248 reviews found that nearly 88 percent of women received
critical feedback versus 59 percent of men. The word abrasive appeared
on reviews frequently for women where the word was totally answer sent
for men's reviews, bossy, referring to women who are powerful and
assertive. There are a lot of theme in women's reviews centered around
being quite, you don't let other people shine as much as you should,
you should be less judgmental about so and so's contributions et. The
third trend were less technical roles. We have a lot awesome female
junior developers entering the scene. A lot of these women have
previous careers in other industries and have other things they're
good at. They ultimately get pull intoed non‑technical roles this make
sense because a lot of small companies employee haves to wear many
hats.  I experienced this I was working at a start up in Denver I was
told I would get to write code and do all this awesome tech
stuff. Ultimately I got pull intoed other jobs, I had to leave this
very high awesome paying job and quit without a job writing
code. Ultimately I chose to quit the high paying job and write code
and I'm really glad that I did, it was the best decision I have ever
made. So I talked with a will the of other women that are struggling
with the same issue, it isn't just me. Mid level developers are
getting pull intoed more management positions and eventually stop
writing code. Men also experience this issue. The fourth trend was a
sense of isolation this was a big one.  I got to talk with Sandy she
said feeling of not belonging in a homogeneous group is one of the
reasons why women lead. You feel like a fraud, a novelty, and you
don't deserve a seat at the table. Eventually you get tired of being
the odd duck. Eileen an awesome engineer at base camp she wouldn't
feel alone if more women gave technical talks. We've seen a lot of
talks by women at this conference, which is rare. Only one percent of
Open Source contributors are women. Pamela Vic Vikers you remember
felt like she should reach out to per manage about how she was
struggling but didn't want to feel the odd person out. Someone to talk
to a lot of times would be really helpful.  I feel at times too, I'm
the only female on an all male engineering team. The fifth trend are
the little things I'll let you read this quote, I don't want to reed
everything. There are a lot of things that pile up over the years not
knowing how to move forward. Things so small you never complain about
them but they're happening day after day. It makes you think, hey, is
this the right career path for me. The ‑‑ ‑‑ the main reason why women
lever the tech industry is death by a thousand paper cuts. The
thousand tiny paper cuts that make up life as a woman in the
industry. So Joanne Cheng our keynote speaker says it gets exhausting
to constantly explain you're a senior developer, for the first goe few
years ‑‑ after ten years it's ridiculous. More often than not people
think I'm brand new or more junior than I am, Kyle. She feels this way
a lot at meet ups. They are usually newer to the community, those that
ask her this, and apologize and take it back when they find out she
works at big nerd ranch. What do these all have in common?  They all
come down to company culture. A Macoo culture, ‑‑ especially in
start‑ups ‑‑ and old boys club. Lack of support and micro
aggressions. Women are leaving tech because they're unhappy with their
work environments and PR N ‑‑ NPR did a big big study found women
lever because of the environments they work in. Pamela said she
dreaded going into work every day and felt stupid. Once she changed
jobs and found a company where they had a better culture. It
completely changed her way of thinking. Company culture was
responsible for feeling miserable but also for her feeling great. The
CEO of air B and N was asking Petr field was what's the single most
important piece of invice, his advice was don'tfuck the culture. The
culture is what creates the foundation for all future
innovation. Company culture is root cause of this problem. So what can
we do about it?  I've seen a lot of quotes like this from prominent
community members and I really think that isn't true. Also, I think
that men are crucial for creating this environment. There are a lot of
women in the tech industry fighting for gender equality but saying
much they hate men. We are not going to achieve equality this way,
we're only going to make it worse. All of us are responsible for
holding these stereotypes in our head. It's everyone's issue and we
need to solve the problems together. So all of us need the have a
culture where we acknowledge there's a problem. If we can't talk about
it openly, then we ‑‑ we have no hope. We also recognize our biases,
Sarah Allen talked about this recently that if we think about our bias
s is, recognize them they will start to radiate into our daily
actions. Google has been doing unconscious bias workshops for their
employees. research shows raising awareness about unconscious bias can
lead to more conscious decision making. We have open casual
conversations, something that offends me might not necessarily offend
you. So we need to be able to discuss this. We have aual where we sink
and question swim, where it's okay to make mistakes as long as we
learn from them. We educate ourselves on these issues. We mentor and
on board, we make mentoring matter. We heard really great talk about
this yesterday as well. I'm really impressed with what sound Cloud is
doing, they're very invested in mentorship, they give employees
20 percent time each week to do this. They also have Rails Girls,
fallows in the office and do internships with them for three months,
which is really cool. We have flexible work schedules and equal
maternity paternity leave policies.  vision C I has 25 days of
required paid time off. It's required and also vacation days, sick
days, moving days, etc. don't count.  I think it's awesome because
it's really flexible to make sure people take the time off and breaks
that they need for a healthy work life balance. Develop a reputation
for being a company that acknowledges health and well being of it's
employees. So we invest in learning, this is super
important. Investing in professional development is the most
profitable step high‑tech companies can take to advance technical
women and retain all if he can thinkcal talent. Google pays for it's
employees to go to classes, conferences that are all geared toward
your career advancement. Offed so why?  Why should we be doing this?
Why should we care?  Improving company cull hour will solve this
problem. Teams with greater gender diversity is twice as likely to
exceed performance expectations, they make better decisions, and they
out perform homogenous groups. But it's bigger than this. Women are
still fighting for equal rights the, women make 75‑cents to the dollar
of a man. We are still defined by our general.  I hope that one day I
can be a programmer not a female programmer. Not to mention
globally. We have made some progress in developed countries but many
of our fellow human beings face atrocities based on their vend E. such
as gender base violence, female general till mutilation. Change change
can start with all of us, we node to be the role models, we are the
builders of the programs that we spend hours a day on. When are you
not your Honor computer or phone, we have an opportunity to create
this culture, this culture that we have dreamt about for decades. We
are the future of innovation, especially in the tech industry, we need
to perform at our best because we are the future of solving problems
that are dire. So we can change this, we need to change this, and
always say to yourself, I really like this quote, if not me then who
if not now when?  Because in the end we're a culture. We are the
innovators of the world. So let's not Fuck it up. (Applause) Thank
you. So it's coffee break time, if anyone has any questions, I went a
little bit over so you can tweet at me or e‑mail me but enjoy the
coffee break.


And stay hydrated. Thank you so much for a very important
talk. (Applause)
