title: Cultivating Empathy
speaker: Dajana & Leslie
---

Next we have a dynamic due owe. We talk a lot about pair programming,
this will be a pair speaking it's on a topic on cull straiting
empathy, a ‑‑ cultivating empathy. And Dajanna one of the original
organizers of eurucamp as well ((Applause))


I told you we could just stand up here and you could just say squid
over and over and they would still love you. It's true. Good afternoon
in thank you for being with us today. Before Diane and I get started
we want to thank the amazing grouch that brought this year's eurucamp
together and brought us all here together this weekend ‑‑ we really
appreciate everything you've done this has been a fee nominal
event. Thank you. (Applause)


So tonight we want to talk to you about cultivating empathy about
building bridges like the bridge you can see over here because as
Leslie as well as me though separately but we had the same
experience ‑‑ experiences unfortunately in companies and communities
where empathy was not a high priority. And that usually leads to miss
communication, holding grudges, and in the worst place even to
contributors burning out and just leaving the whole project.


So we're hope that our remarks here today serve as useful tools for
everyone in the audience to understand the value of empathy, to
cultivate it within themselves and organizations with the final goal
to being making our projects, companies and ourselves better and
stronger.


Yes. That's us. ‑‑


Oh, it's ‑‑ oh, no let's reopen it. No worries, we can deal with that.


I can sing.


Dance your flame please.


Of the gray fortress waterfall. (Laughing) we're on again Who! Of
(Applause).  I love her exactly for that. So this wonderful human
being is Leslie Hawthorn you saw her yesterday in another talk. She
has been doing Open Source ‑‑ working in the Open Source community for
over decade, you don't see it but yeah. And in her past projects where
amongst others the Google Summer of Code and she was the creator of
Google code‑in, right now she's living a happy life as aen expat in
Amsterdam, of course she loves Berlin even better.


That's completely true and I hope to be moving join all of you very
soon. Obvious gliffen the round of applause Diana needs no
introduction whatsoever but to recap she's a past organizer for
eurucamp, a past organizer of the Rails Girls per Lynn workshop, and
she's also a member of the board of Ruby Berlin so this year for the
conference she decided to take a break and to "just" give a
talk. Which is probably just a little bit scarier.


Not at all. No not at all.


So why empathy matters ... first of all it is important that we
actually definem pathy. Empathy is the process of actually being able
to feel internally what another person is feeling. And this is just
distinguish empathy from sympathy whereas sympathy is the able to feel
something on another person's behalf like I regret that your laptop
broke. But it's not the same as feeling that same moment of terror
when you realize that the keynote as just decided to bar of while
giving the closing talk of the conference. Empathy is vital to us
because it help us to be much more effective in everything we
do. Empathy helps to build better products because we can understand
our user's needs and they will do with software that we may have
created for ourselves. It helps us to work for effectively in our
teams because it helps us to understand everyone's motivations and
what they need to get out of our interactions in order to be
successful. And basically everything is a question of empathizing
effectively because it is through empathy that we are able to create
harmony. Yes, so you're feeling into the other person, but it's also
about you too, right. You have to know your feelings, how do you react
in different situations, and how do you understand and act differently
while you are amongst the peers. You probably react differently here
at this conference then you would do ‑‑ or I would did at a board
meeting or talking to a customer, right. So empathy helps you to
enlighten yourself and to learn natural self interest. And I think
that the other important point that we'd also like to make too that
we're going to talk a lot in this talk about the value of exercising
empathy in terms of how it's received by other people. But it's also
very much about you, the individual. By practicing empathy you're
going to be a better negotiator, you're going to be able to get things
done more effectively because people like work with people who know
have their best interest at heart, much more than they like to work
with people who maybe not so much with that. So getting started in our
empathy process ‑‑ empathy is actually a choice. And the two studies
that I'll reference on this slide are document in the a New York times
article from July 10th 2015 called believe it or not "empathy is
actual lay choice" so it's very easy to find. So two of the studies
that stood out in this article to me was one, individuals will
frequently chose to avoid situations in which they think they they
will be forced to have an 'em pathetic reaction.  ‑‑ empathy
reaction. So choosing not to visit a country as a tourist where you
know you will encounter high rates of poverty because this will cause
you to feel bad and uncomfortable. So that's a little bit of a bummer,
but, again it demonstrates to us that empathy is a choice. It is
something that we can chose to do. And when we understand that empathy
is a choice and the value of it we're much more likely therefore to
exercise empathy. Another study found that folks who were primed with
the idea that empathy was a choice, that it was something that they
could cultivate, that it was accessible to them were much more
effectively able to feel empathy and often sought out the opportunity
to do so. In the specific case the researchers were determining if
people who were taught that empathy was a learned skill would be more
willing to think about and empathize with the experience of folks who
were raised with others than their own. Empathy is a choice and it is
your choice. And hopefully today we will convince you that is a choice
that you want the make. Yeah. You were talking about empathy as a
choice, so as surprising as it is it is nothing that you're born
with. You're born with maybe a bit of empathy but it comes through
socialization. Through your parents, through interacting with other
people. And for that, you have to be reflective. How do ‑‑ how could I
be reflective what is that?  It's actually thinking about how you
react ‑‑ what I sad earlier how do I react. So take your time every
day and take care of yourself of your mental health of your health
itself and for being a better empathizer to increase your empathy take
the time write down different situations that you were in and write
down how did I react there?  What did I feel?  How did the other
person react?  What did I do?  And over time of days, weeks, months
you will find a certain pattern of yourself who you are and how you
react in certain situations, you can improve yourself when you are in
other situations that is similar to one that you were two weeks before
and you wrote down I should have done this and that differently.  I
should have done this and that like this. Then you can just think, oh,
I had this two weeks ago and now I try something different. And let's
see how the outcome is then there. Right. And ask questions. Learn how
other people see things. Widen, bauden your own world, your own bubble
that you're in.  ‑‑ broaden your own world, your own bubble that
you're in. Empathy is often built out through adversity, if you're
trying very hard to learn, to understand why something is very hard to
learn that seems to be like this for somebody else. Right.  I have
a ‑‑ I have a little bit of an example last year we had a speaker here
Austin, he is blind since birth ‑‑ and he found this App for his
iPhone that can show him the colors, or that can tell him the colors
of things, he was so excited about it. He downloaded the App, opened
the App and he tried it out, and all it says was black. Black, black,
and he was like that cannot be right, something is ‑‑ something is not
right. And then he was trying to step out of the box and think out of
his bubble and think how seeing people might solve this problem. And
at one point he thought, oh, wait, colors maybe only seen with
light. So he went and switched on the light and used the App and
suddenly it was yellow, purple, pink, blue. There we go. Step out of
your comfort zone, step out of your box, out of your bubble, however
you want to say to that and there you go you will eventually find a
different answer. So getting into our skills building portion of this
presentation, one of the ways that you can begin to cultivate empathy
is through the practice of active listening. So active listening is
the process of engaging in dialogue with another individual or with a
group and when someone has spoken to take the opportunity before
replying to first mirror what they have intake to them so summarize it
in your own words and then add your commentary at the end. So for
example wow! I'm really nervous. I'm not great at public speaking so
I'm really excited that we're giving the closing talk at eurucamp
today but I'm a little freaked out.


Well Leslie I can imagine that you're really really excited about
being here and that you're a bit nervous about being here but ‑‑ about
giving the talk, I'm a bit ... but that's no problem at all, I know
that you're great, I saw a lot of talks and, well, if you're nervous
now that means that you're prepared, you're thinking everything
through, so you will be awesome.


Thank you for this wonderful demo. So the practice of active listening
is a key component in non‑violent communication. And the reason for
the creation of the practice of non‑violent communication is to assist
us to overcome all the way in which we are socialized or cull hurlly
taught to just step over compassion for other people. (Culturally) it
is a natural human tendency to practice selective hearing, to only
hear what we want to hear or to quote one of my favorite movies, to
just stand there not listening waiting for our turn to talk. So
instead of doing that, if we actually slow ourselves down and take the
time to mirror what the other person has said to us, we not only are
able to absorb what they're saying to internalize it, to feel it,
we're also giving them the opportunity to correct us, maybe we didn't
really understand what they had to say. And then they can give us the
opportunity to come to better understanding by saying, actually that's
not what I meant at all here is what I meant. Skill building exercise
number two because this one's Funsie's read fiction. This is one of my
favorite exercises to do regardless of empathy. So a recent journal
published in the Plas journal, I should know how to expand that
acronym, it's in the footnotes, it's a journal of open science. A
bunch of researchers discovered the act of reading fiction helps to
create empathy within the reader. And it is through process called
emotional transportation. The idea that you are able to put yourself
into the position of the characters within the story. To feel what it
is of that they feel through the process of reading and imagining the
story taking place. And for those of you who may feel like it's a
little weird to go through thought exercises thinking like, what would
Diana feel in this situation?  How would she react?  Admittedly it's a
little weird she's my friend, I don't want to be like hey, can I get
into your brain it's nice in going through the process of emotion mall
transportation is the first step of doing thought exercises. It's a
comfortable, familiar way to exercise empathy with the characters from
the page and we can apply that to the process of real life.


I'm a bit curious right now how many of you do read fiction?  All
right, keep your hands up, how many of you have been very, very sad
when the bookend?  All right, almost all the hands stayed up. Yeah,
I've got the same because you're absorbed in a new world with new
characters with new people with new, I don't know aliens whatever
unicorns, love it. And then suddenly the world is just poof away.


And it's that sad thans tells us that we have experienced the act of
emotional transportation otherwise it would not be impactful to us
emotionally that the story has concluded.


Speaking of curious embrace your inner child. Be curious. Ask
questions. By asking questions that also implies a void
assumptions. Again, a talk from last year.  I don't remember
everything off the top, but I remember a especially one slide when I
was ‑‑ I had to restrain myself not to jump up and say hell yeah!
Because it said assumptions are evil.


Thank you Laura.


Thank you Laura. Laura is over there, thank you Laura for
that. (Applause) and I well give you a little example of that. For
example I'm standing here minding my own business and I can see a
person over there or over there, I don't know doesn't matter. Looking
like this all the time ... in my direction ... and I'm confused
because the person looks at me like ‑‑ I'm getting nervous and I now
can assume oh my God I did something wrong maybe I have the wrong
clothes maybe the person doesn't like black, I don't know. And I could
go go in my head and I can build a whole castle of assumptions and
they will build and build and build, what I also could do is just like
walking over, sorry.  I reask nice that you're looking a bit worried
or angry at me, did I do something wrong or am I under the wrong
impression?  I'm a bit confused right now.


Oh, my God, no, I'm so soreiry, I was deep in thought I have ‑‑ I'm so
sorry I'm thought with a problem, I didn't really look it was just
that my head was in this direction. Right. Ask questions. Questions
are our friends. And our best friends ever are open questions. Whom of
you do know the difference between open and closed questions?
Good. Very good. For those who didn't raise their arm open questions
are "W" questions, open questions are questions that open the
people. Where, when, what, why. Where do you go to holiday?  Oh the
bahamas ‑‑ I read this magazine what will you do there?  Oh I wasn't
thinking blah, blah, blah blah whether so these are the open questions
.  then there are the closed questions when you near a hurry. Do you
want pizza for dinner ?  yes. Do you like spinach?  No ‑‑ so open
questions are mainly questions that can be answered with yes, no or
Aaaaaee. So closed questions are this. And so just to recap open
questions are our friends.


So now we're going to shift into talking more about how we can have
effective organizations that help us to cultivate empathy. Obviously
organizations are made up of individuals, but in the way we create the
culture of our organizations, our teams and our projects, we can
encourage the cultivation of empathy. So I think first and foremost
very important is to be explicit about our values and to be inclusive
in creating those values.  I had another example but I through it away
moodily when I saw the signs on the bathroom doors here which are so
cool I think I might steel one and send it to a friend of mine I know
needs it. So the signs that say if you are concerned about the gender
of a person who is entering the bathroom, take these steps, don't
worry about it, they know better than you. That is phenomenal, it is
explicit, trance phobia is not okay here and it is inclusive. Trans
phobia is not okay here, that is phenomenal. And it's extremely
important to be explicit about your values because otherwise people
make assumptions about what is important to the organization, to the
group, to the team. You need to be very clear what your values
are. And I know this is going to sound corny because let's Faye it
most of the time mission statements are crap (Let's face it most time
mission statements are crap) this is not a mission statement saying we
will make the best chocolate chip cookies by using the only freshest
ingreedn'ts .  that means nothing. A good and useful example if folks
look at thought work's web site they have a page where they talk about
the pillars of their company, the things that the company values one
of these is social justice, they talk about how one of the objectives
of their organization, the pillars around which they build their
company will be to do work that creates more justice in the world for
those who are underrepresented or those who have fewer resources,
those who have ‑‑ are less able to help themselves. And by making this
an explicit statement what they're doing is they're not only telling
the entire world, this is what is important to us, they're also giving
their employees, right, the knowledge that this is one of the way in
which we will conduct ourself. This is how we will conduct business,
this is an expectation for each of us as we go throughout our daily
affairs at work that we are to do work that is trans formative in the
world and makes the world a better place for
everyone. (Transformative) and another point to that is can be seen
especially in the tech seen is globalization. Globalization means that
people come into a company from very, very different backgrounds. They
grew up in very different countries under very different political
backgrounds and stuff like this and things that are totally normal for
you in your daily life or for you or for you might not be normal for
the new person that comes into your company, into your team, into your
project. And this comes to assumptions.


Right?


Absolutely another thing that is useful to understand as well when
creating organization, creating culture for those organizations, this
is where leaders come in and play a very important ‑‑ an impactful
role, leading by example. One great instance of this is my friend era
joy backer who has been Bloging frequently about diversity in the
technology industry. She wrote an article called the other side of
diversity, about her consideration of ending her employment with
Google, which is where I met her. And she realized that she needed to
move on, but she wanted to go to a workplace where the work she did
mattered and she knew the people that she worked with valued the same
things that she did. And she talked about reading Twitter and seeing
all of the various news about the protests going on in Ferguson,
Missouri after the murder of a young blackman by officers. And she
noted a deafening silence from most of the people that she knew who
work in the the technology industry. She noticed a deafening silence
from leaders in the technology industry. No one seemed to care, this
was not their problem, this took place far away by people of a
different socioeconomic class and a different race. Not my issue, I
don't care. But by contrast the CEO of Slack a brand new "unicorn"
start up. With a valuation of over billion dollars ‑‑ you all don't
have "B" ‑‑ thank you. Valued at over billion dollars was tweeting his
concern for the protesters and that he hoped that they would be safe
in their pursuit of social justice. And by reading this she realized
that this was the company that she wanted to work for. That this was
the place that she should bring her talents to bear she's now one of
their release engineers, having worked becider capabilities any
company is very lucky to have her. Be explicit about your value,
inclusive and make sure everyone is on the same page about what is
important for all of you to be successful. Oh, my God we have hippies.


They're cute (Hppos)


So Hippos are cute but these ones are grumpy they are letting you know
to discourage Hipponig ‑‑ highest paid person's opinion is the only
one that matters. (Laughing) yes, so only the one on the level that
begins with a C matters. C E O, C T O, C‑whatever so make sure that
every voice is heard in your company, in your project, in wherever you
are, wherever you gather people that have to decide something. I tell
you a little story because that makes it more clear. In any day‑to‑day
life I organize IT conferences.  I organize them with a team that is
very good, like when we communicate it's like a circle of
communication so we're circling around all the ideas that we have and
we are playing with them, we do brainstorming sessions and stuff like
that. And for one conference that came a new person in and this new
person got grumpier and grumpier all the time with every e‑mail and I
was a little bit like what's going on there. And at one point I was, I
don't understand your e‑mails anymore, they don't seem very
constructive, what's going on there?  And this person was just like,
you're not a good manager. You cannot even make simple decisions. You
cannot ‑‑ you cannot decide if we want this speaker or not why do we
always ‑‑ why do you always have to ask us?  I was like, Who that is
interesting. Then I thought okay this person came from a big company
where the managers said you have do this, you have to did this, you
have do this, you have to be finished with this by the end of the week
and stuff like this. Right. And I said, okay, we're working here
differently, we're working as a team, yes, I am the manager of this
project so I have to make sure that everyone is on track and that we
are at the point where we have to be finished that we are finished and
everything is said, but on the road everybody has a voice.  I don't
know everything, I'm not going to all the conferences in the world.  I
don't know every speaker in the world. But you might know him, or you
might know him.  ‑‑ at one point I read an abstract that was so
perfect and I thought oh, my God, I want to have this person at a
conference because this just looks perfect for this or that or
that. And then I brought this in this abstract in and say look at this
abstract it's amazing it would fit there and then there were three
voices, three that said nope, nope, nope. You know what they saw this
speaker at another conference, actually at two other conferences. He
was mean, he was racists, and he was very very not nice. So I said, oh
my God I'm so happy that I asked you. We will not have this speaker at
our conferences, definitely not. So if you are the I pippo, if you
are ‑‑ Hippo, if you are the C level, make sure to be inclusive. To
let everybody have a word. At the end it is your decision, of course,
but you don't know everything, I know ‑‑ sometimes we think ‑‑ we tend
to think that we know everything, but, to be honest, no we don't. And
that's why asking questions and talking to people is very important.


So, again important for all individuals within an organization, but a
cultural value to promote, do not flip the Bozo bit. For people who
are not familiar with the phrase don't flip the Bozo bit, this is
actually from a book written in 1995 by a gentleman named Jim McCarthy
called dynamics of software development. The idea of flipping the Bozo
bit is that once someone says something or does something that you
think is stupid every statement that that person makes from then on is
wrong. Everything they say is put on/ignore and you have no value to
provide to me, to the company, I just don't have to listen to a word
you say. Mind just one time. One time they did wrong. So flipping the
Bozo bit is not useful for a wide variety of reasons, but let's start
with the basics, if there is someone in your organization and you have
decided they're never going to say anything useful you have also
decided they're never going to be successful. At that point you bet
eroff not having them there, they should go someplace where they can
be successful and contribute to the success of the organization and
you can have another human being there doing work that you will
actually appreciate.  I suggest that the problem with you, mind, not
with this individual, in this scenario. There's also the point ‑‑ it's
silly, right this is ridiculous, we're all human beings, we all make
mistakes, there is no reason to decide that one silly mistake defines
a person forever, right. And if you make the decision to flip the Bozo
bit you are cutting yourself off from the opportunity to ever learn
something from that person again. Right. That is not wise. And
finally, organizations where this is common practice are encouraging a
lack of innovation and stagnation and a will be of creativity. Because
if people are afraid that if they say the wrong thing that they will
be judged, that they will no longer be respected, what will they do?
They will close to say something. They will chose to not
contribute.  ‑‑ they will chose to say nothing, chose not to
contribute, they will chose to not engage because they are afraid.


So being inclusive also means make a truly okay to fail. At the end,
yes, we are all human. Humans make mistakes. Surprise. And through
mistakes, mistakes are actually good because through mistakes we
learn. We learn that something is not good. It's not good to leave
your trash ton floor because another person might trip. So you can
actually rewind what you did and do something else instead. And also
do not oh press people for making mistakes. It happens all the
time. And when you find out that a person made a mistake or the person
comes to you and says, I'm sorry, I made a mistake, talk to them
immediately because otherwise it will probably ‑‑ it's like the
assumption, the assumption thing that goes in your head and it's
building up, building up, that is the same with problems when you have
a problem and you're not talking about Itaú BBA will probably grow
bigger and bigger and bigger. And at one point this whole Vulcon of
problem and you will explode and you will sometimes say things that
are not nice, that are not inclusive and might burn the brings that we
are trying to build up.


So, my friends our talk is at an end to just quickly recap what we
discussed today. Empathy is a choice and a learnable skill. And we can
cultivate it through active listening, reading fiction, how's that for
homework, something you want to do any way. Getting to know yourself
and being more self aware, practicing curiosity, and avoiding
assumptions. And within our organizations we can be explicit and
inclusive in our value systems, avoid Hippoing they belong in the wile
not the office not flipping the Bozo bit and ensure that it is truly
okay to fail.


And to quote or to conclude our talk with a quote from Romey always be
kind for everyone is fighting a hard battle that you will not see
(Rumi) thank you very much. (Applause)


We think you all are lovely too.


What a fitting closing talk to this conference, that was amazing. And
it really shows that of a very innovative format as well, the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts, two speakers together are better
than individual (Oooohh) so yeah we can take a few questions, if there
any.


I don't know, is there a girl equivalent to Bromance ‑‑ sorry, we have
the questions. That's us. Any way, question.


Not really a question but I'd like to add to that because I absolutely
agree with what you have said. Thank you for everything you've
said. But whether you follow this advice or not may well decide about
the future of your project or company.  I spent a couple of months in
a company where the C‑person did quite the opposite. And bullied
people never fore gave or forgot the slightest mistake and a lot of
really good knowledgeable people left. Left the company.


Yes. That's what happens. That's what hatches people are leaving
unhealthy environments.


I've actually talked on this topic a few times ‑‑ oh, it's for
video.  ‑‑ I've actually talked on this topic a few times so what can
you do to change an organization where people are bullying or Hippoing
or generally not being 'em pathetic and I have wracked my brain for
the last year and the answer is always the same. Prepare your CV and
tell your friends that you're leaving.


Questions? ‑‑ there's also ice cream ‑‑ oh, no we're out of ice cream.


What do you think, for you personally, has been the most challenging
or exciting thing that you have shared with us here?


Oh, wow! Okay, I have something about the learning to be empathy
thing, it's a process. Do not expect you to wake up tomorrow like ‑‑
today I will be 'em 'em pa thinkic. We are all ‑‑ Empathetic. We're
all human, we all have bad days. At some point, I tried so hard and so
hard and at one point I just flipped out because somebody is pushing
my button and I'm just like oh, my God I told you this like ten times!
Probably not the best answer.


I think for me the most profound thing I have learned is the process
of active listening because I speak really really fast.  I have a
tendency to interrupt, which is not awesome, and I'm constantly
working on it. And I also think I know what people are talking about
because I'm super smart, and the answer to that question is no, no,
no, no. So actually getting trained in active listening and being able
to go through that process ‑‑ because first it sounds silly, yeah,
yeah, you're listening, why are you summarizing stuff, this is
annoying, but realizing how much closer it brings you to someone
because human communication is flawed and difficult and we think it's
easy because we can talk so ... clearly communication is easy, there
are words coming out of my mouth right now. And it's not, right. And
active listening teaches us that it's not easy and that it is a skill
that we acquire and something that we have to work on every day to be
effective.


If you never practice it or the first few times that you will practice
Itaú BBA will feel totally silly.


You will feel like an idiot, and it's okay, just push through. It will
all get better.


More?  ...


Anyone else?


I'm just really interested because I hear these concepts in Buddhism a
lot as well ‑‑ ...


Oh, yeah ‑‑


Is that an area that you look for inspiration or what are the main or
other areas that you look at.


I thought this was about our religious failuation I was about to say
... ‑‑ affiliation ‑‑ dirt worshiping tree hugging pagan. So let's
see, I take inspiration from literature written ‑‑ from folks in
various walks of faith.  I read a lot of psychology journals, I read a
lot of fiction and I don't know, I think I just have learned partially
to be a more 'em pathetic person because sometimes things were really
tough for me, when itches younger I was bullied in school, it taught
me to not want anyone to feel as bad as I feel right now. It helped me
to be a more 'em pathetic person, to value bringing joy and love to
someone's life instead of pain and not ever wanting to be the person
who was the source of pain for another person because I knew how bad
it feels myself.


What she said.


We were separated at birth, don't tell anyone. Okay, thank you. Thank
you very much (Applause)
