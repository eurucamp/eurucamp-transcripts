title: A case against showmanship
speaker: Marta Paciorkowska

So welcome back after the very long Siesta break. Thank you. Who
participated in an activity?  Who participated in more than one
activity?  Very good! Very active people, great.  I know that Eric has
participated in one of the activities and made a beautiful new
shirt. He'll make a habit of changing his out fit more than three
times in a day. He's like a Madonna. That's good. Welcome back and
great to see you all.  I heard that we did a great job on the banana
eating thing. They're almost all out. Next up, peaches, next else
they'll go back. We also heard in Marta that it's very good to eat at
least five times a day some fruit and or vegetables, so that ties in
nicely with the whole peaches thing. Without further adieu, maybe we
should start with your talk right away. Marta is a junior developer
and a senior Twitter ranter, I've read. And will tell us why it's such
a dangerous thing to mention people as being super heros or Ninjas or
rock stars. (Applause)


Marta Paciorkoswka: Thank you, hello, my name's Marta, that's my
Twitter and GitHub handles, I'm software engineer and I'm currently
unemployed. So if you read the talk description. You might ask
yourself the question why do I ‑‑ why do me, why does Marta hate fun.
I hope when I finish that you'll realize I do not hate fun, just a
very small subset of it. So a couple months ago I took part in a
discussion about modifying a user group's code of conduct and the
discussion was very long and very difficult and there were different
views, obviously, and one person who opposedm any modification to the
code of conduct quoted George Carolyn an American comedian who
ranted ‑‑ George Carlin who ranted about the trend to soften
language. And it got me thinking, why mention free speech and why
mention words of a comedian in a setting after all we're talking about
a programming meet up and I do think that is important to be aware and
to speak about how ‑‑ and culture influences our industry in such a
context talking about free speech might be important and might happen,
but in that context I I think that wasn't the case, I think that often
times the actual issue is that we tend to forget that we organize,
participate in, host conferences, meet ups, etc., first and foremost
to share knowledge. And continuing on the subject of jokes, there is a
trend to confuse conferences with stand up comedy evenings. Have you
ever noticed that? ‑‑ should I get a microphone, an extra microphone?
Will this be turned off or ... thanks, it would be, okay. So, I think
there's ‑‑ you noticed this trend, I think I open not the only person
that's noticed that sometimes we really, I know sometimes I'm confused
when I'm at a talk, I don't know I'm at a programming conference or a
stand up. And it seems that we sometimes forget that sharing knowledge
is what it's all about and we've started believing that the speaker
needs to be exceptionally entertaining in the process of sharing
knowledge with us. And, I think this is connected with how we portray
ourselves. Think about it for a couple moments. Who are we?  We are
young, we are hip, we are edgy, and that's how we portray ourselves as
an industry, as a community, as early adopters of new
technologies. And it's also built on positions, we are not like those
Java people. We're not like those Microsoft types in suits and ties
tucked in shirts with their corporate culture. We're not like them, we
are code driven, we are innovation, breasting, we are flannel bear,
rugged coding rock stars. And we still see that in job advertisements
and we see that at conferences and I'll be honest with you seeing
another hip edgy guy on stage kind of makes me cringe. Being edgy is
not original, being edgy is not edgy nowadays, what edginess we
believe that edginess means being controversial, but what is edgy on
stage is actually very mainstream. It's just perpetuation all the
stereotypes and all the negativisms that we see every day and it has
nothing to do with originality. And furthermore this being hip and
cool means that we allow ourselves and encourage ourselves to engage
and cherish behaviors are not associated with corporate culture, and
this has ‑‑ obviously there are good things connected with it. For the
fact that we don't have dress codes at conferences and our events are
generally more laid back. And this is good. But, we still say or do
things that would be frowned upon or found simply unacceptable in a
corporate setting and one of those things is cursing on stage. Now I'm
going to tell you something you might find weird. Last year I had a
conversation within a certain community where it's permanent members,
it's kind of thought leaders, were known for repeatedly using heavy
language on stage to a point where they kind of created a sort of peer
pressure to do it. It's kind of weird to believe that things like that
happen in a group of adults. But it happens. And it's good to have a
strong vocabulary for when you need to express strong emotions like
amazement, anger, frustration, but first, and foremost there is a time
and place for it. And secondly, some people really go over the
top. And should we really do that on stage?  So when you're standing
on stage and you're curing for example during your talk about Docker
it makes you sound aggressive and will alienate you. People will not
want to engage with you, especially if they disagree with you because
they will be scared. And it takes away from your message, people will
focus on your tone not on what you're trying to say. It will make
others feel reluctant to speak. So the mod everyone computer showman
with his strong language, strong opinions, invited to speak at
conferences because he will attract an audience, a very homogeneous
audience, he will help organizers fill the room, but the problem is he
will fill the room with people just like him. Then people who are just
like him will get inspired to get into conference speaking. And we
will per pet chew wait the vicious circle of white male egodome in our
industry and that is going to make people like me just literally go
crazy and leave. Over half of women in technology will leave
technology sooner or later at one point this their careers. Men do
that twice ‑‑ women do that twice as often and men and there's a
Pletohora of reasons and seeing the same people on stage adds to
that. If everyone on stage looks the same that's what we'll desire and
per pet chew wait. We listen to people that look like those people on
stage, we hire people that look like them. We design people for people
that look like them and we will ignore anyone who doesn't. And the
thing is that being a speak has a lot of benefits. It's not only the
financial stuff, like, lot of you won't get paid but a some will, even
if you didn't get paid you'll get accommodations and conference
organizers might cover your travel cost. That's financial
benefit. Apart from all that you gain recognition and rerespect in
your community. You mingle with influential people at speakers dinners
and do not underestimate the value of that. You might, during your
talk while being on stage you might cablely drop by the way I'm
looking for work and you'll have tens or hundreds of people instantly
registering that and remembering that. And it's hard to say how many
jobs in our industry are filled outside of the official recruitment
process, but I found some data that linked in collected based on their
networks and about a quarter of people in tech ‑‑ in computer related
industry will be hired thanks to networking. So who will get hired if
the most visible people always look the same?  So at a conference like
eurucamp it might seem like I'm preaching to the choir because
eurucamp is really different, but not every conference is like
that. And some of you might consider speaking but may be scared. Of a
lot of things or just a couple of things, but, how about we all just
agree to try something different just remind ourselves that more
places can be like this place and that we can do something if we
consider speaking or we can remind other speakers that there's a
couple rules that if we all follow we could have a more diverse
community. So the first thing is that we should also relax and realize
that there is no need to show off. That if we are on stage, if a
speaker is on stage it means that the audience will assume that
there's a certain level of competence that got that speaker on the
stage and that's enough. And despite what capitalism might tell you,
exceptional is optional. Good is just perfect. It's ‑‑ you don't have
to excel all the time, that's not healthy. So we should realize then
that fireworks, are symbolic or having chorus of singers signing
during your conference talk or strong language and excessively strong
opinions aren't necessary for people to listen and to engage. And as
you said earlier they often have the opposite effect. And let's
remember that even all ‑‑ a lot of conferences in Europe and in the
Americas are held in English. But that doesn't mean that every
participant will be fluent in English and the English language or that
they will be fluent in English culture. So if your talk relies heavily
on Memes or TV series ‑‑ on knowledge of TV series obscure references
to works of fiction consider rethinking that, because maybe some
people won't be able to follow. I'm not saying to completely drop it,
because I don't hate fun I've seen programming talks where it was all
about applied Memology and I learned nothing from them. So my working
title for this talk is that you adopt have to be funny to be a good
programmer. And I think funny is fun.  I really don't hate fun, but
fun is not a prerogative and not everyone can be the master of
laughter, and not everyone has a sense of humor and not everyone
should be, it's perfectly okay, it's a truism but we are all
different, and in the end people will want to learn about the topic of
your talk and everything else is optional glitter except actual
glitter that should be mandatory. I'm not joking. So simply try to be
a good speaker. And there's a lot of resources on that, so I'm not
going to reiterate them here, but if you want to sum it up in three
points, you should just speak clearly, rehearse and try not to get
your Ego standing in the way between the audience and your
message. And Kthy Sierra might know this has this great Blog post
about what not to do when presenting and at one point in the Blog post
she writes, the problem is that thinking what matters in your
presentation is you. Because unless you're a paid perform, musician,
comedian motivation speak , you are not the reason that people came to
the conference.  I couldn't agree more, I think if we give in to the
cult of heros we will not have a healthy, thriving and diverse
community, thank you. (Applause) o


Great, are there any questions for Marta?


Hi, thanks for the talk. It's more like a comment not a question.  I
totally agree when it comes to the written part, for example in job
offers.  I mean you read things like yeah, we want to hire the best of
the best and everyone, I hope everyone says that we want to get more
women into tech and we want to get more women into companies and you
probably don't really don't get the women with these job offers, if
you want to have women in tech you probably get rid of these silly job
offers ... yeah ... yeah, way of things, but I disagree ‑‑ I mean we
all have our own opinions, but I disagree when it comes to
presentation of the spoken word. As I really like to be entertained on
stage, but if it's just spoken, I mean yeah we're super awesome ‑‑
something like that I like to I like to say things like that. But it's
also with a wink and yeah with little bit Irony, and I think that's
okay. And it's more meant like motivating other people and I think
it's okay when you can ‑‑ when you're on stage and you can catch
something with your self confidence. And I rather like that. But I
mean I was entertained by your talk and I wouldn't say that you're
really showing off or Bragging, there are different ways of
presenting.  I think I I like showman ship entertaining.


I think I didn't make it clear enough.  I don't think we should drop
all of this, I think maybe we have this drive, like I said to be
exceptional that if we don't deliver a good talk that's not enough,
that we have to excel and make people remember our talks for the rest
of their lives, and the thing is that ‑‑ there is not a talk that you
can give that people will remember for the rest of their lives, so we
should just chill, maybe.


Great, is there another one, over here?


Um, so you're talking about the relationship between the audience and
the speaker, I'm interested to know what do you think makes a good
audience member?


What makes a good audience member?  Well, if ‑‑ Hmm ... well sometimes
I'm too nervous to look at my audience, but when I do what makes me
more nervous is when people sit with their phones, which I'm also
guilty of doing when listening to speakers just because I don't listen
it means that I have ‑‑ I can do things at once but it is kind of,
sometimes discouraging. But it's a small thing, I think a good
audience ‑‑ stays engaged during your talk. And maybe ‑‑ I guess
that's about it.


Any other questions?  Comments. If not another round of applause Marta
(Applause)
