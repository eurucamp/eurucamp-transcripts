On to the new stuff, Joanne you're almost up. She did a talk in your
cap 2013 that I absolutely love about reprocessing, there you go I
loved it. We're very much looking forward to this year's talk. Joann
talked to me about what she's doing for a living right now, I really
like making charts and maps. So that's ... today she's going to talk
about how you ‑‑ how we need make tech a little bit more positive
apparently we're getting all negative. So get more positive and one of
the ways to do that is combining one of your passions with one of the
other passions that we have, which is programming. So Joanne
(Applause)



Joanne Cheng:


Hello ‑‑ oh, that's loud. Okay. So my name is Joanne Cheng, I am a
software developer at Ken I O and this is my third time at eurucamp,
I'm very happy to be here kicking things off. I'm also very jet lag
right now, so I'm just in a really weird mood and this will be
interesting. But tonight I want to talk about Awe. Awe is that feeling
you get when you experience something amazing that makes you feel a
prickly sen stationetion on your skin, some people say it makes them
feel breathless. And generally when you feel Awe it's a mix of wonder
amazement maybe a bit of fear and confusion we realize the world is
much bigger than we think and there's all these amazing things that
exist outside of our own heads one of the things that makes me feel
Awe are the mountains you see here out where live in Colorado.  I love
hiking and being out in nature. And people become motivated when they
feel Awe. These mountains that you see here have inspired countless
beautiful works of art, inspired music and poems to be written about
them. These works of art cause Awe that I know hear them or see
them. The affects of Awe are contagious for many programmers here I
know there's technology out there that Sparkes the same feeling. That
feeling of Awe is what drives our passion for working in an
industry. Perhaps it's using ‑‑ a ‑‑ for the first time or ‑‑ or our
first learning how to program. These are all possibilities that code
can bring. Maybe for some of themore advanced people it's about
reading a new ‑‑ reading about a new well designed language. Thinking
about code as programmers or watching a co‑worker solve a problem. And
for me it was that all the complex work that we do on the computers
was down to a few simple operations. But as I continue to work as a
developer I often forget how to feel Awe, I get jaded and then kind of
fall into these cycles where I don't enjoy programming. Have any you
heard this phrase spoken at your job. Maybe not about computers or but
maybe about Alain language, a framework. Because I do.  I definitely
do. And you know this topic is supposed to be about positivity and Awe
there's a lot of technology that is very, very broken. So remember
this every time ‑‑ because of a poor security system or a simple ‑‑
potential caching a plane and making it fall out of the sky. Or when I
come across, my job when I come across a poorly documented library or
a poorly written library there's a lot of code out there that's broken
over poor decision and lacy development, that's kind of a fact. But
thinking ‑‑ our technology and our tools are broken it's not a
positive ‑‑ it's not beneficial for our working environment. Sometimes
these mistakes ‑‑ sometimes these mistakes that we encounter are
caused by things, by minor mistakes or things ‑‑ or just things that
we disagree with. And this attitude ‑‑ sorry ‑‑ this attitude spreads
to others we work with too.  ‑‑ some might call it burn out but I
didn't quite enjoy programming, I wasn't fascinating with some of the
amazing projects being developed right now ‑‑ librarieses and
documentation I was working with couple with a lock of positive
community and support. Tonight I want to talk about my own adventures
in building myself up again. With programming and other things that
bring me Awe. I'm really hoping this will resonate with some of
you. So, I've always had weird fascinating of combining things that
aren't traditional combination.  I think there are interesting
problems to solve when you intersect two fields that aren't typically
seen together. One of my recent hobbies is dance. I'm now saying this
out loud and I'm kind of ‑‑ it's kind of weird to admit that. I'm kind
of an awkward person and I'm not very good with movement and but I've
been taking pretty much any type of dance class available in my city
of Denver for the past year and a half and I've always watched ‑‑ I
went to a music school and I always watched dancers and envied them
for being able to express themselves through their bodies. And I've
also been too scared because I thought it was too late but ‑‑ and so
the more I started dancing ‑‑ this is pretty close to I was and I'm
still not that great at dance but it's a very challenging hobby for
me, something I feel really strongly about because it's just such a
mental challenge and such a fun thing for me to do. And so one day
after dance class I had a conversation with a friend who suggested
that I try to think of ways to visualize dance. So I should mention
that I I do charts and maps for a living and I worked a while to get
to that point. So ‑‑ and ‑‑ combining my visualizing of the idea with
something that I wasn't any way related to my job was a new challenge
for me. A lot of sketches a few experiments based on visualizing
motion. And also two years ago itches talking about a way to draw
shapes with code and last year I gave a workshop on DJAS here which is
ato draw shapes in a browser. So naturally this year I'm going to show
shapes on a screen so ... I'm just going to set up a little bit. So my
lovely volunteer will demonstrate some of the things I've been doing,
and I'm going to talk ( applause) when I was thinking about capturing
motion one of the easiest ways to capture motion ‑‑ there we go. One
of the easiest ways to capture motion ‑‑ so basically what Kinet does
is takes an infrared scan of the room ‑‑ the camera over there. And um
so we have all these day the points of the scan ‑‑ (Laughing) continue
please.  ‑‑ you have infrared scan on all points in think dimensions
and you copass that information to open ‑‑ to basically a computer
library that looks for a person. At least that's what the code I'm
doing. And once it finds the person it's going to look for the joints
on that person. The head, neck, shoulders. There we go. Right hand ‑‑
is this the left hand?  (Laughing)


Yes, left hand, and all the joints, and so that was my first step in
trying to visualize movement. So after of I had it track the joints I
started thinking about ways to make this pretty and which makes it
kind of artistic so ... ‑‑ it's magnifying all your actions. There we
go. There we go. That's a good reaction. So I just had this idea of I
was basically drawing a bunch of stuff on the screen just following
the right hand which you should be moving, the right hand. Okay, yeah,
soy had a bunch of points and I was able to freeze it but then I
thought of this idea of how to use graceful bubbles just follow around
all over the place.


It's pretty fun actually.


Good. See the bubbles just kind of float around and if you're
actually ‑‑ ‑‑ there's a ‑‑ explains how to create physics and mess
around with physics to create shapes and things that move around like
this. So once I of the got this, tracking the joints and able to draw
with it. I was happy with this idea and how cool it was. Kind of
pushed this idea a little further. So I had this idea of being like a
dancer being able to ‑‑ movement ‑‑ you can dance. (Laughing) that's


It's almost like that. So I had this idea of a dancer being able to
follow the movement so this is what I built. (Laughing) all right,
there we go. Ooooh merging sound with movement ‑‑ so basically I had
in idea of like this harp that kind of was it's own game like
something that kind of flowed like the ocean a little bit. It was it's
own thing, not static just go up and play. And then so what it's doing
is tracking Andy's left hand. And it's just playing the strings of a
harp in sort of this, I call this space art. Because it kind of sounds
like a space thing. all right.  I thank you (Applause) so these were
two just kind of pet projects that I worked on for the past year and
this is a more ‑‑ this is from a really beautiful dancing technology
piece by an artist named Navi.  I completely forgot the name of this
piece. It's absolutely ‑‑ combining passions they just kind of help me
in love with technology and keep me sane.  I really love working on
these projects even though the whole demo disability take too long to
show you what I did.  I never presented these thing in public, the
space art was an office demo that we did as an interactive thing for
people to play with. But these experiments also let me learn about
amazing technologies that I've never been exposed to before.  I didn't
know about computer vision before learning about this, just something
I Googled because I thought, yeah, sure I should try to combine
programming with dance, totally should work. And I realized it's such
a hard field and something that people are constantly studying and
there's so many papers written about it, with math I can't understand,
but it's just ‑‑ there's just so much out there. Learning and exposure
to really thoughtful technology is why I love working as a
programmer. And why I feel motivated at my job. So recently I spent a
bit of time reading about history of Bell labs I became fascinated
with this man up here this is Paul Jen, mathematician, father engineer
all around genius. He withouts an employee of Bell labs. He also did
cryptography work for US during World War II. And his work on
information theory was the basis for technology behind the modern
micro processor. One of the first people to support the idea of
artificial intelligence. Really blown away by how long and how amazing
this man's resume is. But in all the stories I read about him, the
answers that I read mentioned howdies ‑‑ he had a ton of hobbies. Pole
sticking strucker juggling uniany cycle playing music, gambling chess
board games, he owned turtles, but with all these things that I named
he had engineering project related to all of them. He built mechanical
turtle, built electronic board games. He built a juggling machine. He
built a chess machine that became some sort of ‑‑ there was a very
long paper written on it. He also built a small portable computer,
technically the first wearable that could ‑‑ that would observe a ball
this a roulette game and could kind of predict where it would land and
sort of increase the odds of winning. So unusual, totally. But his
collection of strange projects really resonated with me because it
shows that the work that he did was driven by Awe and curiosity not by
negative Ity. The Bell lab didn't enjoy his project, they did
influence his serious research and he did quite a lot of that
too. They lost a genius to a university because one of his projects
was so important to him and his career. So going back to Awe. Studies
that prove that Aou help us to be more 'em pathetic and makes us
better people. There's research study done in UC Berkley recently in
Berkeley, California there's really beautiful trees that are very tall
and are on the campus so these researchers brought two separate groups
of people to the campus. One group of people they brought to the
Euclaptus trees and let them stair for a minute and the other people
they just showed them the university building. So as they were walking
back to the lab someone by the lab would drop all their pens just a
minor accident. The people that looked at the trees were more likely
to help the person who dropped all their pens versus the people who
were looking at just the building. So this sort of empathy and sort of
altruism this does derive from Awe. And there's other studies, I'll
mention this New York times article why do we experience Awe. It's
really a good article if you're curious about this. And I loved
eurucamp and JRuby Conf because the speakers have prepared great
presentations for all of you. You'll meet developers who amazing
things, you're going to have time the beautiful Potsdam or ask someone
about the amazing work they've done with Open Source. So I hope you
all experience Awe this weekend. (Applause) of

Are we taking questions?  Applause
