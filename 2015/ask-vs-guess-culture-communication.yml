title: Ask vs. Guess Culture Communication
speaker: Katherine Wu
---

Katherine Wu is an engineer at Nuraleage, she worked at Google for
five years. She's going to tell us today a little bit about a
difference in culture and how that can affect communication is
difference in culture meaning difference if you're from an Ask Culture
or a Guess Culture I've seen this and it's taught me how to better
communicate with people.  I hope she can do a similar thing for
you. Anyone who saw her at R camp already and super excited to see it
again. Because everybody else can also learn about the differences in
culture. Very good. Maybe we can throw foxes at the people excited,
look, we have at least one person that would be happy with the fox I
think you've never seen me throwing, there's a reason why I did not
participate in any sport activities yesterday. Let's start with a warm
round of applause (Applause)


Katherine Wu: Wow, of it would be helpful to have shorter hair if I
speak next year, pockets and if you grow a little taller too, so I can
see a cross. So I'm Kwu, it's short for Katherine Wu, I'm a software
engineer at New Relic on the Ruby agent team. And I'm here today to
talk about my favorite frame for examining differences in
communication styles, which is known as ask versus Guess
Cultures. It's a difference that can cause a fair amount of tension so
my goal today is to help everyone understand this culture clash a
little bit better and hopefully be able to do better in communicating
as a result. Will's start with an example. So here's the situation
this is you. And this is your friend say Jamie and gentlemen my has a
friend who you've never met named tailor. Tailor is going to visit
your city and needs a place to stay. But you would rather not host a
stranger. And so your friend asks you can tailor stay with you?
What's the instingual reaction in your head. Not out loud just in your
head. Is it oh! I'll just tell them no ... or sit something more like
Ugh this kind of puts me in a difficult position. If it was the first
one then you are most likely from Ask Culture. And if instead the
situation would make you feel really uncomfortable you're most likely
from Guess Culture instead so show of hands who identifies more with
Ask Culture. Oh, okay, less than I expected being in Germany. Who I
debtfies more with Guess Culture. A fair amount, cool, cool, who's
maybe not sure yet, that's okay answer as well. Cool, I have more. So
that was a really quick litmus test, I'm going do a little bit of an
overview of each of these cultures with additional examples to
illustrate which what they mean. Then I'd like to talk a little bit
about the pros and cons of each as well as some further considerations
and then get in some practicalities around strategies for handling
these differences particularly in the workplace. So as far as I can
tell this ask versus Guess Culture description first came out on an
asked ‑‑ post in 2007. The way it's described there is in some
families you go up with the expectation that it's okay to ask for
anything because you're okay with getting no for an answer. This is
Ask Culture. In Guess Culture on the other hand it's much more about
avoiding asking unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. And
the way that you do that is to extend out delicate feelers so that if
it's done really well you don't even have to specificically ask for
something you'll just get an offer. And then even then you have to use
your judgment because if you accept, you imposing too much, maybe they
were just being polite. And ultimately Guess Culture is really about
the idea about putting idea in the position of having to say no ‑‑
putting others in the position of having to say no is rude. This this
is a spectrum, not a dichotomy. Computers are at the further extreme,
you where you have to spell out everything for them. But for people on
the other hand based on my own experience, at least, different region
in the US are probably at different points along this scale.  I am
from the Northeast near New York where if a stranger talks to you our
instingual reaction is what do you want from me?! So I probably place
somewhere along the lines here. The places that have a strong
reputation for being nice tend to be Guess Culture, maybe like the
mid‑west, somewhere along here. Now, I was actually going to get rid
of this very US‑centric section all together.  I overheard a
conversation at the party on Friday between two of the speaker this
week that gave me another example to use. Because once you start
seeing this ask versus guess thing it's hard to turn off. So what
happened was Joe was talking to terns about how Joe's been givingen
this 12 factor App talk, he also has this byte code talk that he would
really like to give at conferences adds well. And Terrence was like
should just ask if you can give the byte code one instead, but Joe was
kind of like Ehhhh, I don't know about that.  I kid you not two
minutes later Joe was like, he mentioned that he is from Missouri,
which is in the Midwest. And then I cornered Terrence yesterday, I
think he thought I was being a little bit weird asking him where he
was from and then he said he mostly grew up on the east coast. So
these are just kind of patterns that you see often times, definitely
individuals will vary a lot so when we look at it on a more global
scale we Americans are probably somewhere along the line here. Where
as what I've known for Japanese culture, for example it's probably a
little bit more over here where as British folks are maybe somewhere
in the middle and as far as I can tell from people that I've worked
with in the past and people I've met here, Germans are probably
somewhere along the line here (laughing) (Applause) hope I'm not
causing an expensive stereotype, but at least one German I spoke with
yesterday said, yes, that's definitely true. Even though I use the
word versus, I really only mean it in terms of comparing and
contrasting. Not that one is better than the other. Because I think
just because you feel for comfortable in one doesn't automatically
make it better for everybody else. Even if you still sometimes
secretly think that yours is the better way to go, I confess I do a
little bit as well. It's ultimately pretty useful and practical for
understanding this difference. So let's go through a couple more
examples, here's one from my personal life. So normally on the
weekends my husband Dan and I each cook one big meal so that we have
left overs for the week. One of these weekends I was thinking through
and I just said out loud I don't think I have time to make lunch for
next week. And the thing I was just talking out loud about how I would
need to figure something out for lunch, but he interpreted that as
could you make some extra food so so that I have lunch for the
week. So he says in response, oh, I'm going to cook two meals this
weekend, I'm over here thinking that's kind of weird, Dan's planning
to make an extra meal this weekend, but, okay, whatever, that's fine,
that's his prerogative. But what he's expecting me to say if I wanted
to refuse his offer and I seen it as connected to the statement I had
made would have been something along the lines of oh, you don't have
to did that. So at the end of the weekend I'm over here thinking why
do we have so much food in the fridge and he's over there thinking,
I'm such a good husband. (Laughing) here's another example. I was
thinking about cutting this section I wanted to make sure to help stay
on time, but then I actually saw this happen right in front of me on
Friday at the party, so I figured I'd keep it so let's say you have
this goal of finding out if a new apartment's rent is a good
deal. You're looking to move to a new city city, what happened was on
Friday I was waiting if line to get a drink, not really paying
attention, oh, like the beer is right over there and I hear the two
guys in front of me talking about how they both live in Berlin. And
then all of a sudden one of the guys just turns to the other and just
says directly, what is your rent?  In my head I was like oh my God,
I'm so in Germany, this is amazing (Laughing) but this isn't something
that, you know, if it's not something that you're used to might feel a
bit too much. Another way to say that perhaps, if you're interested
would be something like I'm looking at this place, is that rent reason
?  It's a little bit better but the person might not be comfortable
telling you you are wasting your money ‑‑ unless we're here in Berlin,
maybe then they're fine telling you that. But a Guess Culture on the
other hand the way they would try the ask for this information, just
kind of generally sort of say, oh, yeah, I'm looking for an apartment,
because they're just going to float the idea out there and kind of
hope that people pick up on that signal that they are interested in
having a conversation about looking at and apartments which include
rents, but if this were me I would just completely ‑‑ it would go
right over my head, I would have no idea that was the goal they had in
mind. Maybe something that's a bit more in the middle would be do you
know what the range tends to be. That gives people a bit of space to
volunteer what they're comfortable with. It's also clear what it is
you want to know. So I want to talk a little bit about the pros and
cons of asking and Guess Cultures each. My aim is to be as fair as
possible to both you can let me know afterwards how well I succeeded
at that. Ask Culture is one that really prioritizes efficiency and
knowing exactly where you stand because there's no ambiguity. There's
no interpretation needed for what you meant. So it helps you get what
you want, at least in the short term. But it can end up feeling a
little bit more confrontation sometimes and end up making people feel
a little uncomfortable maybe even ail enuate them. Guess Culture
really prioritizes avoiding hurt feeling from direct confrontation,
it's generally considered more plight, depending on the culture that
you're in (Polite.  ) it does depend on a shared tight net of shared
expectation. You have to be able to recognize subtle singles that
people are sending and receiving back and forth. If you're like me not
great at reading social cue queues sometimes that can be hard. On the
flip side, if other people don't share your expectations you can end
up feeling like no one is listening do you at all. Some further
considerations I'd like to bring your attention are, well, why are
people the way they are in the first place, right?  I have no idea, I
double majored in psychology in college because I'm a giant nerd, and
I don't understand why people do what they do, so instead of actually
talking to people more, I was like I'll just read some books about it
and take some classes. But, you know, if you think about ‑‑ probably
most of us have some innate preferences here which is then molded by
family and then perhaps the larger culture that we grew up in as
well. And in the workplace, you know, I think companies and teams
often have different standards as well I've been told that Intel for
example is really really strongly Ask Culture where people won't reach
out to you to see if you need help, you have to be the one to bring it
up. Start‑ups on the other hand can be a lot more loose, maybeless
processes people know each other a bit better. It also depends on how
fast that start up might be moving, if they're trying to get things
done in the short term and everything is very transactional it might
end up being a bit more Ask Culture. One thing I've gotten a response
to versions of this tall I've give Minnesota the past,oh, yeah, my mom
is just like that. Ohe my mother‑in‑law it's so hard to tell what she
wants, and so completely anecdotally I do think women tend to be
socialized to be a little bit more in the Guess Culture mode. Maybe a
bit more accommodating, less confrontational, so if you personally
don't match people's expectations and I feel like I fall into this
category, you can often get a different reaction, maybe getting
labeled as abrasive or aggressive as a result. And it goes both ways,
it affects men too if they don't match up to this image of sort of gun
hoe Manley man, they can end up getting labeled as timid in a kind of
negative sense. And so what I'd like to remind everyone is that I
think that people do the best they can with the methods that they know
how. It's really helpful to do what you can to bridge any gaps or
divide there is might be. And so if you still can't categorize
yourself then I'm going to tell you that probably lean guess, because
you're not going to want to tell me no. But I think Ask Culture people
tend to recognize this frustration and not understanding what it is
that other people want. On top of like just being told directly you're
really direct person. This has happened to me lots and lots of
times. But, again it can also be a matter of context, you may very
well be one way with your family with all of your shared history and
then a different way with friends or at work for how you get things
done there. So it is true, also I think that different styles can be
more appropriate for different situations. Such as when you're not
really sure about the relationship between you and somebody else. On
the one hand I think you be a little bit more Ask Culture at either
end of how well you know someone because if it's someone that's just
really a stringer, it's much more brief and transactional you have
less of a long‑term concern about that relationship versus people that
know you really well, they really get you, and you can kind of maybe
feel a little bit more comfortable and drop your guard a little bit at
times. It's all the meme in between that's a little bit of an Ify gray
shown, kind of like if you have a work friend that you're not quite
sure if you're actually friends outside of work just yet, and so you
don't know if they like you as much as you like them and you don't
want to cause embarrassment so you can try to be a little bit more
call your attention when it's in the middle there ‑‑ Cautios ‑‑ ‑‑) I
think you can live in harmony. My husband and I are at opposite ends
of the spectrum for sure and we've been together for over ten years
now. That's worked out pretty well, I'd say. Generally speaking it's
really about trying to step a bit more into the other culture so that
your message is clear, and people are comfortable. And now that you
can recognize the difference at least you're most of the way there. So
if you're from Ask Culture, my very first tip is to make a Guess
Culture friend who can be a little bit of a guide and interpreter for
you because this is what Dan is for me, I'm confused by some
interaction I'll bring it home and he'll help me dissect it to sort of
see what was being said between the lines. Another item is to remember
that it's not just what people say, but what they don't say as
welt. Because you might not have actually heard an explicit no in
there, but it wasn't an enthusiastic yes, either, so pay attention if
there is any hesitation when people are responding to you. And
finally, we all make mistakes, you know, so if you realize too late
that what you said might be misinterpreted that you maybe sent out a
Guess Culture signal that wasn't what you intended go ahead and
apologize. If you're from Guess Culture, which seems like a fair
number of people in this room, when I was practicing this presentation
and asking my husband for advice. He was like Guess Culture people
don't need to hear this, they already understand what's going on
here. But I couldn't answer the acemetery for leading the slide blank
so there's a couple quick points. If you're angry or frustrated
someone because it seems like they're in your face all the time,
remember that they might be unaware of the rule, because it might take
a little bit of education to bring them on board. Consider also that
softening a no with an excuse can also end up hurting people if in
fact they didn't understand that what you said was a no. So for my
last section here I'd like to talk a little bit about how you can
handle this culture clash in work situation. First I'm really huge
fan, of course, of course, of discussing up front communication
styles. For me when I have a new manager or a mentor I'll often keep
asking questions and try to gauge how strong the responses might
be. This is something I would often say to new managers of mine when I
was particularly focused on improving my communication skills. But if
you're from Guess Culture, perhaps, maybe you or your manager has a
goal for you to participate more vocally in meetings, so in ‑‑ you
could perhaps say something along these lines to try to make progress
towards that goal in a safe and comfortable way. And from the
manager's point of view, you can offer up several opses to chose from
versus having to ‑‑ putting someone in the position of having to
decline. When you say, oh, yeah, we have a few options that would work
AB or C try be enthuse yaysic for all of these options if you feel
equally open to any of these three. There's one particular situation
to be a little bit wary of and that is if you're in Ask Culture person
managing a Guess Culture person.  I think it's really important to
constantly remind them that they can say no when you ask them to take
something on and give that positive reinforcement. no, it's rally okay
if you don't want to take on this particular task. If you near a
sitwhere you're given someone the illusion of choice you get their
input but later reverse the decision without explanation they will
never say no to you again even if you want them to. Another thing that
helps is not to set up processes where people have to ask because it
can end up penalizing some folks. For example a conference travel
policy where people always have to bring it up themselves and make the
suggestion and make a case for it. Or like Rebecca said yesterday like
a formal mentorship program that junior engineers have to ask about
joining versus defaulting people in because as Rebecca said the people
that need the most help are often also the ones least likely to ask
for fit. Ultimately if you have a report that's ‑‑ you think is really
Guess Culture and they rarely make direct requests. If they do, pay
attention to that because it's a really rare event. And so, another
technique that if you're a Guess Culture person that you can use is to
reference back to old conversations. So this happened with a friend of
mine, she wanted to ask for a raise after she gotten new
responsibilities as we were talking it through and kind of going back
and forth with wording she might use she mentioned that she actually
gotten feedback in her last performance review that her boss wanted
her to be a little bit more assertive. So I suggested that she
reference back to that conversation and it totally worked. She totally
got a raise. Because I'm such a good friend I did not ask for a cut of
that raise. And so you know one thing that you can do is go ahead and
use this talk as an excuse for starting some of these
conversations. For example I went to this amazing talk at eurucamp and
then fill in the blank for yourself afterwards. Another common area
this might come up at work is in getting and giving help. It's again,
something when I have mentors formal or informal that I really like to
have a conversation about beforehand. Talking about things like what's
a good way, what's the best way to interrupt, is it through ‑‑ send an
e‑mail tap someone on the shoulder, what's the frequency we should
check in, weekly one‑on‑one or should I know signal that headphones on
means don't bother them till the headphones are off again. And in
general what's the guideline I should give for myself of how much time
I should let myself be stuck until I reach out to someone and say
something. And so again, once we have that conversation to start we
can go back and reference what we had agreed upon there. So, you know,
this might come up in certain situations like a stand up where a
junior engineer update might be something like I'm not sure I rally
understand this feature because what they're doing is that they're
hoping people will see that they don't understand and then step up to
offer help. So, you know, Christoph mentioned this in his talk
yesterday on diving into a code base that it's totally key to ask for
help when you're stuck. And I completely agree with that. What I'd
like to point out here is that for this person they are asking for
help, even if they're not exactly saying can you help me. And so it's
good to try to pay attention subtle differences like that. And you
know if you're in the position, you can go ahead anginal for yourself
whether the way you're communicating is effective or not. Are you
getting the help that you need. If not, it could be that people are
missing your signals and you can either try alternate a little bit how
you send those signals out or have a conversation with people to help
them pick them up a little bit better for you. And on the mentor side,
I think a really important point is to rib that just because no one
has specifically said this is not working for me doesn't mean that
everything is okay. You can go ahead and ask questions, you know,
maybe really gently to try to find a little bit more about what's
going on. So this is kind of like that really good question somebody
had yesterday which is how can I get honest feedback about whether I'm
being a good mentor or not. So, you know, a lot of people might say
something like this. Do you have any questions for me, which is not
bad, at least you're asking and showing interest rather than just
waiting for someone to come to you. But, another way to try to draw
that out might be using that offering options thing again. Where can I
help more in this area or this area or maybe some other suggestion
there. Starting from the standpoint that assuming, yes, there are
areas where you can improve and help people say this is the starting
point that we are work off of. And pairing, of course, often involve
communication and people have different styles for that. Something I
find that hems with that is to have a little bit of a pairing retro
especially when things haven't gone well or you're having a hard time
working with each other. So it can be really available to do this sort
of analysis. For example I have a good friend at work Katie, she's
Canadians, they're known as being really nice and they're often very
Guess Culture as well. Chef said something like oh, I'm not sure I
absorbed enough out of that last pairing session.  I could look at
this and think, oh, well she's telling me she didn't get enough out of
it, that doesn't have anything to do with me.  I try paying attention,
oh, yeah, what would work better here. It's good that I picked up she
was expressing a concern there. This could have used a bit of
improvement.  I could of instead said hadding like oh, yeah, we were
in an exploratory phase maybe next time we can save pairing for a
little bit later. Offering up options how we can try it differently,
opening it to a discussion about different potential solutions
there. One phrase that I often end up using is something like, hey, I
have a question, but it is totally okay to say no to that. It's just
something you can say before you ask people for something. And it
works for Guess Culture people as well. Because you can use this to
remind yourself that other people can say no to you as well if you're
feeling uncomfortable about something you need oask. Thanks to some of
my expert Guess Culture friends that I practice thinks talk with this
can be further improved. We can page it a little bit more 'em
pathetic, maybe changing the last clause to like it's okay if you're
busy, I understand if you're busy, and leaving an opening for people
to say that, they'll get back to you at another time. And so over all
I really like to impress all of us that I think it's really important
to be thoughtful and try to help each other out. For example in
meetings if you're a Guess Culture person you can go ahead and enlist
and Ask Culture type of person to help advocate for your point of view
in a more confrontational setting. You can step in mene when you know
that certain situations might need a little bit different approach. Be
thoughtful and be the one to call it out to carve out space for
everyone to feel a little more comfortable. So, ultimately this is a
topic that I'm a little obsessed with. And I love to talk to people
about I, so if you ever have any questions for me, please just
ask. (Applause)


We have time for two real quick questions.


So thanks for the talk, I really liked it. I was wondering about in a
classroom situation like how would you handle it. It's really easy to
tell people if you have any doubts about what I'm explaining you can
ask, but if they're from the Guess Culture, they might not how would
you apreach that situation.


That's a good question how what to do in a classroom situation. It's
one of these things where I think it's good to offer a lot of
different venues to approach you with question questions you might
have.  I remember even for me, even being Ask Culture in college I
would make really good use of office hours or reaching out to the TAs
instead where I might be able to ask a question one‑on‑one versus in
front of the entire lecture hall there. Another thing I think that
would help with those situations is again sort of assuming that people
do in fact have questions and opening up to give them options of where
they might be confused in. We just reviewed this topic based on past
experience as a teacher I know these are common areas where people are
a little bit confuse Chad of these three areas should we spend some
more time reviewing a little bit. Then people can offer you
information that way.


Cool.


One more.


Looks like a very enthusiastic ...


Hi, I don't have a really great way of phrasing this but as a guess
person I have a really hard time getting answers of ‑‑ out of people
who I kind of identify to be guess people as well. You know like we're
both kind of being polite around each other and I can never get an
answer. What would you recommend for that kind of situation.


So this touches on another really pet topic of mine which is something
I've been working on over the last few years is really trying to be
more comfortable with letting myself be vulnerable to other
people. Have you seen that really often Ted talk by Brene Brown the
power of vulnerability. It's totally work it. I'm not a huge Ted talk,
it's a good use of 10 or 20 minutes of your time. In those situations
where you're both dancing around a topic and you're feeling a little
bit concerned about, you know, causing someone else embarrassment, or
feeling embarrassed yourself as well.  I think try trying to practice
to being vulnerable and open yourself to making mistake or hurting
someone or being hurt yourself can maybe help you get through that a
little bit more. It's kind of scary, something to practice over time
B.e, but it's really helped me in my relationships. I'm just sort of
an awkward person, sorry about that, but we can work it out.


Thank you that swatches an amazing talk.


Cool. All right, thank you everyone. (Applause)
