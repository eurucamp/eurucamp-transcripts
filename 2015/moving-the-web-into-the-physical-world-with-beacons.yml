Another rounds of applause for Meike.


Hello everyone, so, I have been working as a Ruby developer, and last
year I decided to quit and move to northern Sweden to study human
computer interaction. And during my studies I have got to play around
with a technology called Beacons, and I thought that would be
interesting to share today. So let's imagine we are at a large ‑‑ a
much larger multitrack conference and I can think of a couple of
questions I would be asking myself during the day. Like for example I
would be wondering, is the next talk in the room I'm currently sitting
in interesting for me or not. And I might decide I want to go
somewhere else and look at another talk but then I need to find
another room. Soive need some sort of map, navigation system. Or, as
an organizer I might have some schedule changes and I want to inform
everybody that is currently at the conference. It also might be that I
want to make my talk a little bit more interactive and do some sort of
group voting with the people in the room. All of this is, of course,
possible today but it's a hassle to navigate through the webpage to
find the information that is currently important for me. So Beacons
can help improve these scenarios. And what are Beacons and how do they
work?  I have some Beacons here. Little tiny devices, battery powered,
and what they do is they constantly send out a signal and that is just
like a lighthouse. So it pretty much works the same so that Beacon
constantly sends out a signal and if you walk past it as soon as
you're within range you can see the signal and then decide if you want
to interact with it or not. If you don't want to interact with it, you
can just walk past it and nothing happens, but if you do need local
information you can look on your smartphone and then find whatever
information is available there. So you might wonder location based
services we already have GPS, but if you have it switched on your
smartphone all the time it drains your battery and also it doesn't
work indoors and it is also, for some cases, not precise enough so if
you have a bus stop timetable prototype that I will show later it
might be important to know on which side of the street is the person
currently standing on. Okay, but what about QR codes, QR codes are a
nice way to like ‑‑ that you don't have to type URL into your
smartphone, but also it's quite a hassle to scan the QR code, you have
to be really close and also you have to focus the camera and also I
have never met anyone who likes QR code yet (Laughing) so technical
facts. Beacons are based on blue tooth standard, more precisely on
blue tooth low energy, so what that means is that it has a lower range
than classical blue tooth and also lower throughput, so it's not for
sending data back and forth, but it's just good for triggering
notifications. And a Beacon costs around 10‑15‑dollars and the range
is 10‑30 depending on what kind of Beacon you have, up to
50‑meters. And it doesn't drain your smartphone battery if you have it
switched on all the time. So there are current of currently two major
players on the market, the I Beacon standard has been around since
2013. It's controlled by Apple and targets iOS devices. And the
Eddystone standard which has been released only 3 weeks ago is from
Google. It's Open Source code and it targets all operating
systems. And when we look at the Beacon payload, what kind of signal
the Beacon sends out then it's I Beacon from a broader perspective,
it's a UUID that's been sent out and the Eddystone sends out UUID URL
and Telemetry, if you want to check the status of your Beacon like how
much battery power is left ‑‑ Telemetry. What ESARIS does that mean?
I'll show on this slide. If you have an I Beacon it will broadcast
UURID that is programmed to open up an App on your smartphone. So as
soon as you're within range of an I Beacon it opens up an App that's
been programmed for and there is some sort of interaction that is
meant to happen then. And if you have an Eddystone Beacon it will also
be ‑‑ it is also possible to wake up an App on iOS devices, but also
on Andriod. And ‑‑ that I have been working with and that has been
available earlier, not just three weeks ago is that Beacon's broadcast
URL, so basically any smartphone can receive a URL and then it just
opens up in your browser. That's the vision for now and you is to have
an App installed that scans the environment for Beacon signal, but
it's meant to be built into a browser. So how does that look like?  In
my studies I built a bus stop prototype so it's pretty simple
scenario.  ‑‑ just imagine you're standing at a bus stop where there's
no digital information displays. In's information displays where you
see how many minutes the next bus leaves, but it's not there at every
bus stop, so I had a Beacon like this, you can push a button on it and
then you can save a URL with your smartphone on it and then it
offed ‑‑ and then you ‑‑ as soon as you are within range of the bus
stop you can switch an your smartphone screen and then you will see
the notification like this one saying departures from the bus top that
you are currently at. And this is the physical Webapp or some sort of
other App that is scanning the environment and that now shows up the
notification. But it's a silent notification, you don't see it unless
you switch on your screen. And then you click on it. And then you end
up within the App that just shows the URL again, in the future it's
supposed to open up directly in the browser. And then you just see a
very simple Webapp that's just normal Webapp like any other App like
Sinatra that pulls information from a public API about when the next
bus will leave. Make use of the current time and the current place I'm
at and show the information that could be important at that moment, at
that place. Okay so bus stop seems to be a good case to use Beacons
for. What else is there?  So first retail is of course interested in
it, they want to send you discounts as soon as you enter their
store. Also museums, you can make some sort of game like indoor
navigation thing to make the whole museum experience much more
fun. And also make information more accessible, of course. Airports, I
built another prototype that as soon as you enter an airport you see a
list of all the departing flights and then you can lick on it and then
you can subscribe to updates on your flight. So you get a push
notification as soon as the status of your flight changes. Then
restaurants, so, you could walk into restaurant and then have the menu
on your smartphone immediately, you click on it, order your food, get
a notification as soon as it's ready instead of having these physical
buzzers. Also of ‑‑ guiding, walking up to a walking trail and have
the map available for the trail you want the hike on. And also bike or
Karen tall, for example when you're in a foreign city you could just
walk up to a car to go or bike, subscribe to the service and after you
go. So for my master thesis, I did some user experience evaluation
with these prototypes. And so what I did was I had the two prototypes
that I talked about, the bus stop and the airport. And I also had
another video of someone that was buying a snack from a vending
machine by the same technology, clicking on the phone, ordering a
snack. So what my participants did they compared it to other things
that are already available, like for example bus App or timetable
brochure or airport information displays. And what they came up with
is they described the prototypes as very up to date, personal working
instantly and easy to use. But they also noticed, of course, then they
were highly dependent on their devices and the energy and they were
also quite skeptical when payment was involved. So ... is this all
relevant today?  Or what's the status of it?  So it's pretty much
prototyping, status I would say. And I found some numbers 30,000
Beacons at the end of 2014 and 4.5 million by the end of 2018, but if
that's going to happen, nobody knows. And what I can say is that the
of Eddystone standard is only available for three weeks now, now it's
possible to target all operating systems and not just iOS devices, and
also the Chrome team has sneaked their way into iOS, so if you have
the Chrome today widget you can activate it. It scans for Beacons,
it's one step towards not having an App installed and making it
available for everybody everyone. So that has been released a week
ago. So there's a lot of movement in it and I'm excited to see what's
going to happen in the future. So, 15 minutes are not much, so if you
have anymore questions, you're welcome to ask me.  I also carry some
Beacons with me, so if you want to, you can install an App and find
out what's there. Thank you (Applause)


Questions?  All the way in the back, oh my Gosh.


I'm so sorry for making you walk all the way. Do you think that
Beacons are really a web technology or not?


Well it depends. You can have Beacons to open up apps, then it is just
not web development, obviously, but the Eddystone Beacons just send
out the URL, so what you build with it is just web technology.  I
think that's the more exciting thing about Beacons because that's
going to work with everything and you don't need to have an App
installed. And like you don't have to ‑‑ you probably don't have an
App installed of your airport or something and you still might want to
use some services like get updates on your flight.


Yeah, I understand the one thing that I've been wondering about is
Beacons are really good like personally instant, but the load time of
like a mobile webpage is anywhere between 5 seconds and 8 seconds. So
do you feel like the future of Beacons is like the worldwide web or
more integrating them into apps?


Well, I can't say which direction if it's going to be more popular in
combination with apps or with the web, I don't really know so
... we'll see what's going to happen I suppose.


Okay, cool, thank you.


Thank you all ‑‑ next one. Okay. You're funny. I'm wearing the wrong
dress for this.


Hi, I have the impression that we will have a similar problem to
fishing males with Beacons, if there's an official vending machine or
bus stop Beacon and I put my rogue Beacon close to it I can make
people believe that they're talking to the bus company. Have you
looked into that?


No, not yet.


Short and simple answer. (Laughing)


I'm wondering if Beacons take off and they're very popular and you're
at a shopping mall and there's like 200 Beacons within 50‑meters, how
does that work from an HCI standpoint?


I haven't tried it out yet so ... it would be interesting to
study. And for like if everybody installs his or her own App then ‑‑
Google has some sort of sorting already so it sorts out the thing that
is most close puts it on top, so you have some sort of ‑‑ yeah,
sorting already. Yeah ... that's all I can say for that.


So for the ones that interact with apps you actually have to install
an App before you phone will contact a Beacon, right?  Because I was
wondering how does it work when you have the URL thing ‑‑ do you
actually have to allow it to contact your phone and open a web site or
something or will it just do it on it's own?


Well, for now you have to have an App installed or the chrome today
widget on iOS, and also you have to actively click on it. So if you
have the App installed it scans the environment, but it doesn't notify
you actively. It just shows that there is some information and if you
decide not to click on it, you don't do it. And it also made secure,
at least the Eddystone from what I have read it doesn't track you, so
... did I answer the question.


Do you already know or have you tried it?  If it contacts you a URL
how does that work?  Is it just gone and give you a notification I
would like to open this web site or does it just open the browser or
...?  Do you just need this Google today?


You have to click on it to actively open it in the browser. And it is
meant to be that it is built in to comb so that if you have home
installed it would start showing this notification (Chrome) I'm sure
you would be able to switch it off. On the chrome today widget you
have to confirm you want to have this physical web thing activated. So
you have to actively say, yes, I want my phone to scan the
environment.


Okay, thank you.


One more question while Davy sets up.


So what's the payload that can go into the URL, the whole logic of
the ‑‑ how large can the URL be?


For now the URL needs to be really short. And so what I did was I had
pretty long U RL and then I also had the parameter which said at what
location I'm currently at, then I just put it into a URL shortener and
saved it on the Beacon, so it is limited.


Thank you, thank you Meike. (Applause)
