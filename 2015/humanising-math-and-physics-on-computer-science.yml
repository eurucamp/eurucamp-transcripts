There are some very that is if I biases around science, it's
supposedly very boring and difficult, we hear this when we're
young. And we think this is true as adults, but hopefully today Analee
will change the way we think about science forever.

We're putting up a disclaimer page first. Who loves science?  Who's
ready to be converted to a science lover.


Me ...


Yeah ...


For some reason it's not working.


Science, yeah (laughing) we're still good on time.


We have an announcement. Anybody have boarding passes, if you're
flying home and you need them printed, we have a printer here, so you
can actually. We actually need to find a cable, so if we find the
cable (Laughing) it's a conditional statement. If we find a cable, you
can e‑mail your boarding pass to Info@eurucamp.org and we will do our
best to print them. You can ask if it actually works at the
registration desk where you signed up.


I'm not sure, I'll find that out.


Hi, everyone. Sorry. (Applause) sorry for the inconvenience, science
problems. So okay nice blank screen, very interesting. Does anyone
know what's going on?  The of


I don't know. Okay. Cool, so the first thing I would like to tell you
it's about this interesting equations on the screen. So we'd say that
the first is Faraday ocean law of induction and so on and so on. By
that time some years ago I was in a electromag anytism class and the
professor came in good afternoon and started showing these equations
as they were natural for us. For me it was weird. So what's this
triangle and what's the sign?  So how many of you have this weird
experience of learning things like this without context?  I mean how
many of you had ‑‑ at least one experience like this and it was
totally frustrating.  I see many people here who had frustrating
learning experiences, I don't know if it was intentional but ‑‑ I'm
talking about teaching adults, which can be frustrating too. And this
can cause different reactions, you can't sleep. You of can feel
totally lost like this panda. Or you can feel like I'm in the right
place ‑‑ maybe some people can understand at first glance, but it's
not everyone. So I came to talk about what I do, I'm a developer, I
like all of this extra things in my free times, organize meet ups, ‑‑
any we this is a quick disclaimer, I know that we are from different
place of the world so for some of you education might have been
different.  I know that ‑‑ I know some people in Norway and Ireland
that had a totally different background from my, but I have some
friends in United States and Europe we had a similar background when
we talk about learning and learning especially science, math physics
and so on. So if you don't share this experience, just be aware I'm
talking some examples that I have lived and some friends ‑‑ they have
lived similar experience. So why are you talking about math and
physics.  I mean I don't know about your graduation course but I study
engineering and I had all this subjects related to math and physics,
did you have similar subjects at least one or two. So some of you had
similar subjects and my learning experience for them was a bit
frustrating.  I mean, yes, they were okay, I had nice professors, but
they rarely contextualize me about what I was doing or why I was
learning that. And that became a really sad and scary and any way ‑‑
so every time I was in acaulous lesson, usually ‑‑ in acal cue louse
lesson most professors came and said good morning, good afternoon
(Calculus) I also ask them why, why are you teaching me this?  Why do
I need the know this?  Shouldn't I be writing code?  Or why do I need
to solve this equation or where am I going to use this. Have you ever
made this question to yourself when you learn something. Even for a
framework sometimes you ask yourself why am I learning this or why am
I learning this this way. Any way of I usually had bad experience, I
was almost expelled from some classes by asking this. But still I
think they're very useful. So most of my professors and friends their
rayly provide me a context of ‑‑ rarely provide me a context of what
was going on, why I was learning that. So this may ‑‑ I mean, I was
really frustrated by that time. And sometimes this lack of context
confuse us. Think about yourselves, how many times do you try to learn
something and you got totally confused?  I mean this happens, we are
human beings, especially if you don't have a context sometimes someone
starts a conversation and you don't have context and you get into the
middle of the conversation and you understand totally wrong. This
happens, this happens with math and physics too. So it could also
dedemowty vase us.  ‑‑ demotivate us. Sometimes I search for the
mathematics and most of them are like I hate math and there's a giant
list of homework and someone posting photos of the list saying hates
math or same for physics, I mean it's scary. Statistically the number
of hate associated with math is higher than love associated with
math. Why?  Such a beautiful work. And then something more started
happening.  I mean this was feedback for me.  I started doing some
courses and we needed to provide feedback for each other and then I
thought ‑‑ I was becoming a many sheen, started you putting numbers
and forms and proofs. My colleague who gave me feedback, we were going
to the same course. He said ‑‑ he gave me feedback after analyzing my
document. Please be more human, I can't understand you.  I didn't
provide him any context and and I started putting numbers and proofs
and weird structures and he got scared. And it was when I started
thinking, I should be changed, because I am frustrated and I'm doing
nothing to change this reality so I need to do something. And then I
started to think about some techniques to humanize the teaching of
math and physics, I was able to put some of them in practice during
our undergraduate course and after my graduate course so the technique
number one that I would like to show you, I don't know if everyone can
make something but then at least we can try. The first technique that
I saw that is really useful is to tell the story behind what you're
trying to teach. After all we are all humans behind science.  I mean
the guy who created a math equation for something he's also a human
being. Like you, like me. So I started telling to the professors like
hey, could you please tell this story of this equation?  And some of
them were like sure. So, let's start the class in 16th century this
guy wrote this equation. No, not this kind of history.  I mean life
story, not history. And I was surprised that most of them didn't know
or most of them why do you want to know this?  I want to know this
because I want to suns how this person achieved this result. There
must be some reason for this person to have studied this topic. So
telling the story of the human being, not the world history behind it.
I figured out it was very important. So I have some examples that I'd
like to share, but as we are all human beings, I started studying the
history of some science and the history of some topics and I could
figure out we have very interesting stories. We have family drama
behind it. We have tragal death of really any mathematicians for
example. We have amazing random facts of someone was studying a
subject in mathematics and then he discovered very interesting subject
in biology this is very interesting, you know. Because this becomes a
bridge between the topics. So let's try an example, what comes to your
mind when I say the name Kepler?  Kepler's laws. How many?  Three,
good. Good. But personally who is this person?  Who is the Kepler guy?
I mean he didn't take laws out of his pockets, I have three laws let's
share. No, that's awkward, I don't want to think about this. So when I
think about Kepler he has a very interesting life story. You should
read this person was chased by Catholic church.  I mean during his
entire life because I don't know ‑‑ do you know Kepler's history?  I
see a few hands here. So, during the time that he was doing his
research about his Kepler east laws the Catholic church wanted you to
believe that the earth was the center of the universe. Which we know
it's something like weird. But by that time they wanted to force
everyone to believe this and one parenter important figure that's
starting ‑‑ one important figure started to say hey, the sun is in the
center. Was a person called Capernicus and he was following
Capernicus' idea, that's why he was chased by the church his entire
life. Another random fact but interesting, do you like star wars?
Star wars is classical science fiction movie, probably Kepler is the
first person in the literature story to write a science fiction
book. That's ‑‑ did you know this?  He wrote a book about an
expedition to the moon. And I'm talking about 17th century. Which is
super cool.  I mean ‑‑ we can tell that he has a strong relationship
with the creation of science fiction and nobody tells us that. Why?
This is very, very interesting. So Kepler he came from a very poor
family. He had a horrible childhood and luckily he had a very rich
friend Tycho and this guy provide him instruments to make his
research, but this guy passed away and Kepler was alone again. So he
had a very lonely life and he was being chased by Catholic church the
entire time, even though he was able to make his research and prove
with mathematics and physics that the orbit made by the planets were
Eliped that was incredible because that the time people were also
forced to believe only in a K ‑‑ book so Kepler spent a lot of time
trying to prove that the orbits were a circle, then he ended up giving
up after ten years of study, and after ten years he had that
imaginecal moment of Ah‑ha it's not a circle. So it's something that
is not into an eclipse book. So he had a very interest life story of
the this could be a bridge to teach about renaissance period. We could
connect better to subjects that we study. We also could teach p facts
about inquisitions about chase chase and other important persons that
suffer during this period so we could connect the facts with a lot of
stuff. And we can connect math with literature, which is
beautiful. Because sometimes when I studied I saw things very
unconnected. And we can start building bridges to this. Another
example of ofEuler, what do you think when I say Eule? Russia.


Yeah, we can actually think a lot of things because Euler was a person
in many, many, many areas. He has a very sad story too, he became
blind ‑‑ he was totally blind and still able to do math. He is an
example of someone who had incredible memory. He could memorize like
of the multiplication table for more than 600 numbers, which is
weird. Any way and when we talk about Euler we have a very interesting
example of a person who wasn't happy with just one area he made
studies into biology, medicine, physics into geology, so it is
amazing.  I mean when Euler died the publishers still had material for
the subsequent 50 years after 50 years this guy passed away there was
new content being published. And the publishers were releasing
anythings every fifteen days, so you can imagine how how many
different things he wrote about. It's ‑‑ he was blind so imagine he
was blind and he solved equations about the moon orbit and he was like
blind. So you can start motivating people that physical Disabilities
shouldn't stop you to do amazing things. This also can teach us about
medical issues. If you're studying medicine or biology in the school
we could connect math and medicine again. And this can also be used
for children as an example to ‑‑ you know, provied ‑‑ stop bullying
sometimes we see people that are different.  I have colleagues who
have visual Disabilities and we can, like, show the children like,
hey, we have amazing people and they were blind. So start from the
beginning.  I mean Euler story is a story for a movie. But also
talking about movies, a second technique would be producing more
movies about science. But not about, like the of ‑‑ a drama based on a
figure but a movie where you can show the amazing things done by
science. So one movie that I really think we could make is a movie
about this guy Evariste Galois V you heard about him?  I see a few
raised hands, his life story is amazing. Leadership died by the age of
20, by the way. We could still make a movie. He was very involved with
French history. He was really good with math and he was also tightly
involved with politics. And he was famous not only for math but for
being involved in how do you say rebel yens. He was arrested several
sometimes, he was being chased by the government and he was there
still doing math during his free time .  that's amazetion. Imagine how
many things you can teach related to history and also related
math. And he have showed us a lot of interesting things about math
. Everything that he created of locally was ignored. He submitted his
papers to the universities and they were like, Ah, he's just a
revolutionary he can't do math. So again the stereotypes, just after I
think 20 years after he passed away his work started to be recognized
as very original. Any way we have very interesting things related to
Galois. And if you don't know about what he has done for math he's the
creator of group theory which is the basis for modern algebra. Just
that. Just ‑‑ you know it is so amazing and almost nobody talks about
his work. If you go for group theory you're going to see amazing
applications. So it is important to remember that behind science there
are human beings. We must start thinking about this. This movie
technique worked for Alan Turing is the movie imitation game, which
went very well. There was ‑‑ it was selected for the Oscars, so movies
can change the way our culture sees science. Offed the final part that
I would like to present is how to connect math and physics to compare
science subjects. So the first experiment that I've done and working
well is to teach new percal methods into algorithm analysis (Numerical
methods) they are very connected. And so what is a new percal method
in mathematics?  You want to solve the equation by the traditional
way. You're going to do some different arrangements, some discreet
arrangements.  I's just algorithmic ‑‑ we joined two subjects, which
was the mu percal methods class ‑‑ new percal method class and
algorithm class, we got great results. Locally we had very open minded
professors who accepted to work together and we made this run pretty
well. Of course don't forget to tell the story behind the new percal
method analysis ‑‑ numerical method analysis. And the story behind the
algorithm. It's important. The second thing that ran pretty well we
started to teach statistics with UI/UX, so we usually have A B test,
which is a good case to study statistics, can you see that how these
two topics are very connected?  You need analyze data when you are
studying. Hey, is my UX good?  Do I need change anything?  You need
analyze the statistics when you're trying to improve this matrix. It's
a good case to teach statistical instruments. So we also had an
experiment where we could join part of this subject, it also ran very
well. And we saw that these students were also happy to be able to
apply a theory concept into something related to compare science. Of
course, we are ‑‑ we are humans, we are sometimes we make mistakes as
many of you said in the previous talks. But it is important to try, I
mean, if you are unhappy with something, we need to try to change
it. Soft the results that we saw is the students were much more happy.
I have never been a professor at a university.  I made this all by
being an observer and trying to help the professors to organize their
content. But what I saw if my colleagues that they were really, really
satisfied with the results. And which was good for the subjects, which
was pretty sad because when they were attending their regular calculus
classes which had no connection with anything he started to perform
very bad, I mean very, very bad. That was the bad experience that they
had. It shows that we should connect the subjects more. If it makes
people happy, why not connect them more. So my blast quotes about this
is like I've seen that in software engineering we try to connect the
areas, so we are trying to bring the ‑‑ people with the software
engineering people with the UI/UX people and make them work together
because we know that if we bring different people to different areas
to make a team we get amazing results. Why can't we make this for
traditional university training?  We should be doing this. And my
personal feeling about this, after some time, you know, trying to
connect the areas is that we are not fully ready yet. We should keep
fighting.  I mean sometimes I feelizelated from the math
department. Sometimes I feel they don't want contact with me. The same
for physics and we should all be working together because the limits,
the boundaries of research of computer science, which is quantum
computing, quantum physics they're all together. If you start studying
quantum computing it does a lot of math, a lot but it has a lot of
algorithms so we need to work together. Offed to end up the session a
friend of mine he sent me this. I'm not using algebra today ... so
that was not cool and I told her, hey, you're using your phone and be
sure that behind your phone there is a lot of math and this works
beautiful, there is beauty behind it. So don't spend your time blaming
your colleagues or your professors or maybe your family, we won't
solve anything by blaming people we need to make our own
contributions.  I mean after doing this work with some open minded
professors, I mean I try to do my best there. But I started writing
what I knew about math history in a personal Blog. It's free. And then
I wrote tips on how to humanize each section of the things that I
studied the history, so it might be useful for someone. It's a small
contribution it's better than spending my time and blaming oh that
professor is boring stuff like that. We are all human so the same way
I make mistakes they also make mistakes, and if they had a bad
instructor for education the chances of they provide you ‑‑ the
expectations for education are lower, so we need to do our jobs, we
need to tell them, we are not satisfied, let me help you to change
this.  I really believe that if we are working and putting our efforts
to make software development community work together why not put
science as a big picture to work together.  I mean I really ‑‑ like
attending programming conferences, I miss seeing people from
programming and math at these conferences, I would like to ask you to
make some contribution, invite your friends who are sometimes not
directly connected with program development should attend a conference
because sometimes we have ideas that they don't have. And they can
help us to solve the problems that we have and vice versa, we can help
them. We should start working with science people in general. So thank
you very much (Applause) I would also like to thank my mentor Maccos,
helped me a lot.  ‑‑ Marcos ‑‑


We we have time for a question. We need to share the microphone ‑‑ who
has a question?  We also have time for zero question. One short
announcement before the break, if you lost your glasses and they look
like this, I have them. If you can't see what they look like
(Laughing) please come find me, I'll be here at the
front. Thanks. Okay, fifteen minute break, be back at a quarter to
five. (Applause)
