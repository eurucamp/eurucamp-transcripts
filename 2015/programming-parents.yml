So the next talk is a talk I've been very much looking forward to
becoming a parent changes a lot in your life but certainly not the
ability to work or want to work, it's just very exhausting at
times. But Daniel is going to explain to us how we can create better
workplaces that better facilitate parents and are more welcoming to
parents. I'm very curious to find out how that might look like. We're
just setting up. I'm giving him my microphone because ... who in the
audience is a parent?  Anyone has a kid in day care today?


Good experiences?  Yes, of course, good experiences.


We can take it away.


Daniel Schweighofer:


Thank you for coming it's awesome to be here. Thank you. Really
nice. Okay, yeah, well we're talking about programming parents and I'm
for myself I'm a programming parent well I'm 35 years old head. Hetro
white Cis‑man. Father of one little child, if you hear someone out
screaming, it should be mine.  I think we have to leave soon
(Laughing) well, I'm also working for the institute since 2000, the
last two years I've been working as a parent and totally happy that
I've actually found a family friendly work space at POS pulse, it's
really awesome because I have searched for a long time to do it. Yeah,
I'm also a political person, I'm doing a lot of political thing, I'm
using in a self organized housing project. I'm from Berlin, you know
us. Okay, what do I need to do ‑‑ we're going to do ‑‑ I billion tell
you a little bit about what it means to be a developer, what it means
to be a parent. We will talk a little bit about work life. When I'm
talking about what it means to be a developer parent, we will have
some intermissions after each of the parts, then a little bit about
start up culture and then we're going to family friendly work
spaces. And in the end I will tell you how I am doing it. Well, how I
am trying to do it. Okay,let's start, what it means to be a developer,
well I know every one of you kind of have an idea but of let's just
sum it up. For me it's a craft you really have to learn how to do
things because literally we just ‑‑ . There's a will the of thicks to
keep in mind so ‑‑ there's a lot of things to keep in mind so it's
hard to concentrate when you're doing this because all these things
are coming up, well, I found that awesome work ‑‑ it's really fun to
do it, it's highly rewarding, it's really nice. And, yeah. It's
really, it's a good thing to do, I think. And also we have to keep in
mind that it's important for our social identification because well,
it's a fundamental part, I mean you will know that when you meet
somebody new at a party and they say, okay, what are you?  You just at
first most time say what is your job because we identify ourselves,
with our job. And the interesting fact of developers is that in the
beginning of the '60s and '7s it was done by women ‑‑ '70s ‑‑ it
somehow shifted and nowadays it's well, mostly done by men but as we
see in the Ruby community it's going to change, that's really fine,
it's really good, we need that. Yeah. Of because it's mostly done by
men we have to also think about well I have kind of toxic work climate
because people tend to do ‑‑ to say, okay, we all work this way, we
work really hard ‑‑ coding as I mentioned before needs a lot of
concentration ‑‑ you have to keep track of a lot of different things
at the same time, you don't want to be distracted because human task
switching isn't a fine thing and if you get into apps you need a lot
of time to get back in the flow and it's sometimes really grinding and
nagging especially if you're doing debugging, it's not nice. But it's
awesome and it works. Okay so now I have a another idea whats to be a
develop E. next we'll do what it's like the be a parent. But first
we'll have an intermission, a short story about work. What is
work. The interesting thing is when you first find work in the old
ages it's just sum of missions ander and tasks that you somewhat
get ‑‑ somehow get ‑‑ somebody give it to you or you require it for
yourself and it gets redefined in the age of information with the
Protestant it's the work, we identify ourself with our work nowadays,
it wasn't always this way, yeah really interesting thing if you want
to know more there's an interesting book from Max Webber, already done
a talk last year, I will link it in the slides when I publish them
on‑line. Okaye okay, so let's start what it means to be a parent. Well
funny, it's also a craft. You have to somehow acquire what it mean for
you to be a parent how you handle it, how you handle your child
because each child is different from each other and each child is
developing and you have to evolve your craft to do parenting .  and
it's really a complex thing to do. And well it's extremely important
because you don't want to Fuck it up because this was ‑‑ there is no
full disaster recovery for parenting and there's no roll back, so you
have to do it right the first time, but you will make mistakes it's
just this way. And the funny thing is, it's also social identification
because of it's ‑‑ well, somehow relevant where we have to say it's
not so relevant if you are the father because, yeah, okay, you the fat
er, you have this attribute, you tier father, but, well, most times we
didn't expect anything about it besides the father because
traditionally the mother stays home, the father could just continue
his life and welcome home, pats the baby and then doing other work and
that is obviously wrong because we have 2015 and I think we should
evolve. Yeah, it was done by a womaned now a day, yeah, it's luckily
there's father who are doing it and the bad thing is that we're giving
them cookies, oh, nice, you're a fat their stays at home, you're cool,
man.  I mean sure you could encourage them, but you could also give
all these mother's cookies who didn't get any cookie. So parenting
itself it's a task which needs a lot of concentration because we have
to be really fast, especially when they're really young because they
could be really fast and they could be surprising really fast if you
don't expect it and the ability to do tasks is somehow restrained
because would youn't concentrate because all the time you have to
think about, okay, what does this child do?  Oh, didn't hear anything,
u‑oh, that's bad (Laughing) and yeah, it's a task with which also
limits your time you have because you have to ‑‑ so you have to
concentrate so much on it that you didn't ‑‑ well you could do some
homework, maybe, but you know it's just shrinks the time and it's
also, well, often grinding and nagging, I mean you could just imagine
how it is when somebody screams at you, literally screams at you for
an hour. We have it from time to time. Well, let's go to the next
intermission, it's about care work, and care work is really
interesting because it's everything which is related to, well you
could say from a capital listic point of view to keep the family
running. It's doing the laundry, it's a lot of work and well if you
want it's a lot of work which has to be done because there has to be
food, there has to be clean space, there has to be clean clothes,
everything like this. And it's somehow you can't wait for it. And of
the thing is if you just live for you alone, it's not so much work
because you don't make so many things dirty, you don't have so many
clothes you're going through in the week and it's not a problem, but
if you are a parent it is a lot of work. And if you want to, like how
much ‑‑ I invite you everybody you you could have a free week of what
is care work at my place, it's no problem, just send me an e‑mail
(Laughing) I would appreciate it, it would be an interesting
experience for you I guarantee you. And the sad thing about it's not
accepted as real work by society even if it's real hard work to
do. And which we have to keep in mind at the moment when somebody
says, okay, I can work 40 hours or so. And I'm also a parent that
means that somebody else is doing the care work because it has to be
done and for me it's ‑‑ I don't think it's right, I think it's totally
false that somebody is doing all this work and didn't get any of ‑‑
anything out of it and somebody else gets all the well social status
and cookies and stuff. What is the price?  Okay. Let's talk a little
bit about work‑life balance. It's a shiny new thing. New because we
have this like a few years to say, okay we are a generation of
work‑life balance. We want to have a real good life and the funny
thing is that sometimes I don't ‑‑ I don't have the feeling that
people will think about that when they use this work ‑‑ because for me
it's a little bit more than just all these perks we get which are well
most of you would be used when you're working for start up because
it's ‑‑ yeah, it's not the same for everybody. So it's really cool to
have beer in the fridge when you could make some parties in the
afternoon, but the problem is that parents couldn't attend parties in
the afternoon because somebody has to bring the child to bed. And it
couldn't always be one person ‑‑ well if it's always one person, I
think it's ‑‑ I think it's obviously wrong. And for me it's also
accepting that ‑‑ well ... there's just more to do you also have to
keep in mind that if you have party each ‑‑ so you go to party each
Wednesday and there's always this one person who couldn't attend, and
this person who couldn't attend, it's a parent. So for me work‑life
balance is about balance and the thing is it's about balancing the
amount of time we're doing for work and you're doing for your life and
for parents it's more important because we didn't have so much time
because we have not in our time amount on the day is just well
shrinked. So we starting to compensate, we're starting to be extremely
efficient what we do in our time, but in our culture we're not used to
value the time of others. We're used value everything but not time.  I
mean you could think about how strict are the meeting times in your
company. And what it says if somebody just starts a meeting at 50 or
30 minutes later, I find it really disturbing sometimes. And there are
places where you could have where this work‑life balance is a little
bit better or extremely better. There are places where people have the
flexible of log times or identification times it makes people really
happy. Employees could have breaks when they need them without having
big struggle to do this. Okay. So let's talk a little bit about
start‑ups. Of and talking about start‑ups because I think most of
Ruby's ‑‑ what things are done in start‑ups or companies that have a
start up‑ish culture.  I don't know many companies that would do ‑‑
well, to be fair I don't know any company who do a real big Rails or
Ruby installations and has a start up culture. If you know any, please
tell me. So let's talk a little bit of start up concepts because most
times start‑ups are just founder related. The thing with this founders
are often young, they're often without children and they have most
times little experience about leadership so they just can't think
about what it means to be a parent and while often start‑ups have
often tied plans and ‑‑ tight plans and low budgets, I have this
feeling that start‑ups often ‑‑ well I have experienced from time to
time this context where okay, you have 40 hour, 40 hour contract and
if you work more you don't get a compensation for it. Quick
information for you if you work in Germany and you is a contract with
say if you work overtime you don't get compensated for it, it's
illegal you could just go to your union or go to some judges could
just say, okay I want this money because it's legal for you to get the
money from overtime. Just some information.  I think it's important
because I have a feeling not many people know it. Yeah, maybe you
should somehow do a talk about well worker's right and information
thing. But that will be another talk. And, yeah, start‑ups most times
didn't have structures, so they don't have ‑‑ they had flat
hierarchies and that means if you have a flat hierarchy everybody has
to talk with everybody because there's no defined way with information
flows. And this is totally perfect if you have the time to be there
all the time, but it's not if you have other things to do with the
time. Start up culture is often work really hard ‑‑ work long shifts
and some magic happens and you just sell the shop and everybody gets
lucky because everybody has his share of the company and will get next
and it's really motivation I can tell you that. And also start‑ups
tend to do things at first we just do it shiny so customers are happy
and all the things which have to do ‑‑ which have to do ‑‑ has to
happen automatically in the background we do it first by hand because
we just have to sell it and then we make the magic happen
afterwards. And this is totally fine you have all this time to be
there, but if you are a parent and can't participate you somehow get a
little bit isolated. It's also important to think about the culture
fit thing.  I mean you know it from work, where culture fits in it ‑‑
culture fit anyone?  I've seen it from time to time, I have people who
send me oh we have this fine culture we're doing things like, I don't
know we're doing things like with races and circles and stuff and we
have some parties and look at the pictures and all these guys like
Whhoo oh, no will not answer them. But that's ‑‑ ‑‑ two minutes
okay ‑‑ maybe there.


Okay, I'm going to my normal speed.


Okay. Let's go to the ‑‑ let's talk about family friendly work
spaces. Most times to have a family friendly work space it's about
meeting activity times. It's about schedule them early, it's about to
let people know when the meeting time is and the best thing is when
you work asynchronously .  so doing home office is perfect thing to
do. And if you do remote office because you is to work
asynchronously. And if you work from home you can also well code
distraction free is the child somewhere else and also has this thing
that you can work at times when other people don't work because
sometimes this happens that you will be woken in the night, you get
the baby to sleep and then you're awake and say, okay, time fresh,
what I I'm doing, okay, I'll do some coding, why not that's very
good. It's also very good when people just have the understanding that
bad things can happen, so you say, okay, I understand that this code
is broken but my kid has woken their leg and there's no roll back for
that, so sorry I have to fix it now. And it can be hard, but the thing
is, I think work‑life balance is really better in places where you
have family friendly thing because while everybody can profit if it
and it's ‑‑ it's really rewarding even if ‑‑ also if you don't ‑‑ if
you aren't a parent. Well then people tell me, okay, how you doing
this so I tell you a little bit, it's mostly about organization. So we
do a 50/50 split of our time. We have this complex shift system if you
want to know there's a German article on my Blog about it. We try to
even out the care work also have to say while I'm socialized as a man
so it's somehow not so easy for me to see tall care work. It's
definitely ‑‑ sometimes it's really hard to see okay, I have to tidy
up all these things even though I know I have to tidy up all those
things (applause)


Found a workplace where you can work 35 hours a week, which is really
fine, it sounds maybe strange for you, but for me 35 hours a week
solves a lot of problems. And I can do home office when I need it. And
that helps a lot. So let's do some summary. If developing and
parenting is both hard and rewarding both together is also hard and
it's also damn rewarding. And also parenting help has a lot of work
but it also shrinks the time and I think we want a lot more family
friendly work spaces because it's better for everybody and start up
culture for me it's mostly toxic and Patriachic, I think we just
better fix it. Thank you (Applause)
