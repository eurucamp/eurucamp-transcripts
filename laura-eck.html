    <p>Hi, implore a, I work for test-cloud ‑‑ in Berlin, as a Ruby developer, I’m and today I would like to talk about icebergs, but cat lockicic and also a little bit about products and culture. So, let’s start out with the icebergs, as you probably know, icebergs are quite big, and the main thing about icebergs is that the biggest part of them is under the surface, even over the surface the part is letty big, and the part under the surface is the part you don’t see, unless you know it’s there and you don’t really see it. The second thing art iceberg, they’re pretty damn deadly if you don’t pay attention to them, you remember titanic, right and, in intercultural studies, this picture of an iceberg is often used to explain the concept of culture. As in the part above the surface being the part of a culture that you can see. If you go to a different country you’ll see people speak a different language, people eat different things, they behave in a different way, all the obvious stuff, and there’s huge part under the surface that you can’t see the reasons why people behave like, that ways of thinking that cause different behaviors, maybe ideas that are engrained in people because that’s how they grew up, and make maybe they themselves don’t even know about that. So, today I’m going to talk about launching your product that’s already there, maybe you already launched in your market, and if you want to go to a market that’s culturally different if you want to launch it there, that’s what I’m going to talk about, and I will try give you some ideas about how to navigate all those nasty icebergs and not crash into them and thus make your product launch successful. I have a little story about that, for starters, I used to live if Bangkok for a couple of years, that’s what Bangkok always looks like in the traveling, you know like pictures and everything, that’s more like the reality.  I mean it does sometimes look like the other thing too, that’s what you get every day and when I was living there, I was working at a small German company, the boss was German, and we once had this situation where my boss ‑‑ wanted one of my co‑workers to get something done, it was a task, he went to her, this is what needs to be done, I want it like this and that and I need it until then. And what happened was, she didn’t do it, so my boss got really mad at her, and she was always very unhappy that he got mad at her, the day after I talked to both of them to fix the office atmosphere because it wasn’t really nice like that, and I talked to meboses, my boss was a German, German person, if you know what I mean, and so, what was the problem and he was like, well, you know I went to her, I told her once very clearly this is what I want you to do and until then, I don’t get why she didn’t do it, I I needed until then. And yeah, it makes sense, I went to my Thai co‑worker and asked her about it. She said, well, Laura, he only told me once, how was I to know it was important because it happens that this Thaland, in a work context, the more officen you mention something, the more important it feels so it will move up the task list, and thus by only mentioning it once, as you would do it in Germany and assume that people would just do it because they understand that you mean it’s important, well, he only said it once so I kind of put it back there and do all the other stuff first. And ‑‑ yeah. Henry winkler once said a very smart thing, assumptions are the termites of relationships. That is certainly true, I agree, but I would go a step further. In my opinion, assumptions can be the termites of everything. Making assumptions can cause a lot of problems thus this is the first message for today, assumptions are evil. Do not make assumptions, especially if you’re talking about a very complex situation, as in like going to a different culture and working, if, I mean of course you have to make some assumptions, because this’ how the human brain works, you can’t like know everything and predict the future, but try to really make sure, if you’re dealing with an intercultural context, do not guess, do not think like, well, if I was a Chinese person that’s what I would feel about all of this, actually go there and get yourself some solid facts. How do we get those solid facts?  I’m going to give you three points there. This is a very wide field, I can’t go into details about, like, everything, I’ll give you a couple of ideas, what you need to watch out for, what you need to get in to, we can talk about that in more detail later after the talk, but, yeah, so I’m just going to give you an overview here. And we will start with market research. If you can’t see what this is, this is a golden callly flower, a vegetable, this is a golden Cauliflower being sold on the internet if a golden Cauliflower can be sold on the internet, you have a petty good chance that you can find a product for your market as well. P what are different factors for that?  Different factor toes are for one thing, who are you talking to?  Your audience. Where you’re going, which is at one ‑‑ on the one hand the country, the market you’re moving to, the other thing like product placement. and also the timing. So how do we start out?  First thing do not do cat logic. It’s a box, I will fit, doesn’t work for cats, won’t work for you either. So, you really want to ask yourself a couple of questions, it’s pretty much standard, but you always have to keep on ion what culture you’re talking about, you ‑‑ keep an Yew on what culture you’re talking about. Does my product fit the market, is there demand for my product in this market. If will is, great, if there is no demand, can I create demand for my product?  Because, you know, it’s not always what people need, it’s also about what you can make people want. So, if you can create this demand with your product, that’s fine as well. You also want the find out about whether there are any similar products or competitor in the market. And, if there are no competitors, then you need to go a step further, which a lot of people forget, which is were there any similar products in that market that have failed before my product?  Because that’s something you can learn from. Because you don’t want to run into the same wall that a competitor did before you and then just like crash, and burn. You can actually look at it and go, like that’s what they did wrong, I’m not making the same mistake. I have at my company we do crowd software testing, we shall site, mobile apps, once in a while we also do hardware tests, and we once tested this kind of device, this is not the exact device we tested, but this kind of device, this credit card reader you can attach to your is that right phone, then you can accept credit card payments, and it was a company that wanted to move to Germany, with this device and like we have a really big tester crowd, so we have like over ten thousand people, but we had really really hard time actually finding testers that had an active credit card of the brand that was required. They wanted a MasterCard, they wanted to figure out if that played well with the device and the App they had and everything, we had rally really hard time finding testers for that, we were like, how sad, that’s a lot of people, right. And then we looked at some numbers, and turns out, these are numbers, I found them, they’re a little bit older, 2010, 2009, because that kind of data is usually something you pay for, right, but if you look at the average dollar amount people spend on credit card transactions in different countries the picture becomes pretty clear.  I mean, like a lot of the English speaking countries, I want’s very normal to pay with a credit card, couple of Asian countries, South Korea, Japan, and then you go down there and you’re here with China, and France. And then, all down at the bottom you have Germany. Where in 2010 the average dollar amount spent this credit card transaction was a 158‑dollars. In comparison to almost 8,000‑dollars in some other countries. And it becomes even clear if you look at the number of credit cards that were in circulation in 2009, and if you compare, for example, that in the USA, there were 686 million credit cards on 314 million inhabitants of the country. And in Germany there were 4 million credit cards and 82 million inhabitants. It kind of explains why we had a hard time finding those people even if we had like ten thousand people to chose from. Of and that was really useful information for the company that tested with us. It’s not exactly the kind of information they were looking for, because they really wanted to figure out if they device works with the credit cards and the App, but, that’s really something you want to know, I mean it doesn’t mean you have no chance, because in Germany it’s also a thing that you can’t really pay with credit cards in a lot of places. So, maybe if you make it easier for people to actually accept credit card payments, like, you have a chance because people will want to pay with credit cards more. But it’s definitely something you want to be aware of. All right, next point, user experience and design. Keep if mind, I’m not a professional design E. but, it doesn’t really matter if you’re the person who will do all this in the end or if you, like if you hire someone to do this for you, the point is you actually to me about it, what you to do and what you to be aware of. And I have a little task for you now, will show you two things, I want you to look at them, and then try figure out what think are. And if you ‑‑ don’t talk your neighbor, just, like try toty about I. You might know if you’ve been to Asia. Okay, if you think you know what one of these things is, raise your hand. If you know what both of these things, raise your hand. Great there are a couple of people, very good. For those who do not know that’s what you’re seeing. Of and it’s really not something unusual, right. But this is not what you expected to see. What you expected to see, if youty about a wassing or noodle strainer ‑‑ about a Wisk ‑‑ you could of probably figured out what these are if you, like kind of sit down and think about it, and, you know, like try to figure out what they, do would you have arrived there, but, you know, you would have needed to put in some mental effort, you would have needed to put in time, and if you think about the time that an average user spends on your web site, you know, like downloads your App and tries to figure out what it does and how to use it, that’s not really something you want, because most people do it for a couple of seconds, if they can’t figure it out, or if they really fled the try to understand what it does, they move away, they we delete your App, go to your competitor’s web site that’s better structure, that looks a way they can understand, if they just look at it. This is the Japanese web site of Rakotan, Japan’s biggest on‑line retailer, one of the biggest internet companies in the world, not a lot of people know that, but it’s true. This is what a Japanese person would expect when they think about a web shop. Where they go for on‑line shopping with a lot of products like all this, you know, not very sophisticated fun style, as you would think as a non‑Asian person who can’t read it. Of (Font style) this makes sense in airgap needs context, absolutely. But this is an international company. So, if they had wanted to move to, you know, say, Germany, you would probably not be very successful with this kind of design and this kind of shop layout. So turns out, Racodan actually did their homework (Rakuten) that’s the German web site, that’s what you, as a German maybe, or really a mesh from a more “western” context would expect to see. Another example, this is the US American McDonalds web site, looks pretty okay, not a masterpiece or anything, it’s nice and clear, like big product placement in the middle, you have the menu on the left, you can find stuff where it is, it’s clear or anything, but for example to a Thai person, this might look like the most boring place they’d ever seen, and they would probably never go to that kind of restaurant, to them a this web site would look like a lawyer office, or an architecture firm. So they might expect to see something like this. Fun is a big thing in marketing in Thailand. That’s how you attract people, you want them to go to a place, you tell them it’s really fun there, the colors are really different too, colors mean different things to different people, if you put that much like bold, that many bold colors on a web site for a German audience, you as a German probably will go, what?! And not go to that plagues. Even if you’re not going to change your design, this is a pretty straightforward log‑in page, neutral blue, works with most countries, you still have to translate this to the language of the country you’re going to. And if this language happens to be written from the right to the left, at least you have to flip over your design, right, it’s if the a big thing, but it’s something you have to be aware of. If you look at the green button, the sign up button, suddenly becomes much bigger because that language just has longer words or more words to express the same thing, there’s a lot of languages like that, you know Germans they like their long words as well (Laughing) and you mightv experienced that, you are in Germany, you might have dealt ‑‑ you might be German, you might have tried to move into the German market, whatever it is. Let’s imagine you have a web shop or something, just your personal project, you know, whatever, it is, and you’re like, well, I’m going to Germany now, I have this order button, that says order now, and you’re like I have to translate to German, oh, my God it’s going to be a long horrible word, it’s going to mess up my design, you put it goo Google translate it’s says Jetzt Bestl willen, you’re look, Ohhh lucky me. You did it’s fine. Merrrp, that’s not how it works because there might be other stuff you need to be aware of as well. Because you’re actually in fact not allowed to put the word order Best elen on a buy or oridance e button on a German web shop or a web shop legally locate in the Germany. Why is, that in 2012 your friendly jeer man lawmaker on occasion on a couple of web shop cheating their customers on their order button like continue or sign up, something, people would click it and then accidentally buy products, which is obviously not okay, you can’t like, cheat people into buying your stuff. But then your friendly German lawmaker sat down and said we’re going to make sure that no German citizen is ever cheated again in any web shop, they worked in their usual thorough way, and what they came up with is this, so you’re not allowed to put things like ‑‑ obviously something like sign up, or continue it’s not okay to put on a buy button, you also cannot butt Bestellen, which is order, what you can put there is the stuff on the left side, which is order now, liable for payment, enter contract now, liable for payment, in German that’s what it looks like, you have these two line buttons, and doesn’t really look very nice, kind of as an after thought they added this Kaufen, which is buy, they assume if buy is there, people will know they have to pay, if you put order you might not know you have to pay. Like lucky you can actually put buy on there otherwise it’d be really problematic. That’s probably what you feel like right now, like all this stuff you have to keep in mind, like, you were like, well I really only wanted to go to one other country how can it be that much work. This is stuff you want to be aware of before you do that, and it’s not stuff you want to find out after you tried your launch and nobody buys your product, and I spent all this time and money and it didn’t work. Testing once you did all your market research, you found out there’s a market for your product, people want the buy t, maybe, you can create a demand, you figured out that people in that market really like green, so you designed everything in green, you turned it around because the language is written from the other side and everything. What you want to do is you want to test it. By testing I do not mean automated testing or integrated testing, you want the grab some people from that country. And do not like sit down and take your App and go like, well, if I was a Thai person and I would be using this App now, I would be feeling like this about it right now, actually go and get some people from that country. You can pay for that, some companies will do it for you, you can ask your friends if they know any Chinese people for example and just get them, get them to meet up with you and show them your App and look at them when they use it, like you can do it on a very amateur level or a very professional level, but in something you really want to do because you want to make sure it doesn’t look weird to, like, people from that particular culture. All right, let’s recap a couple of points. Which is do market research not cat logic. Do not, you know, just go like, I will fit in that box somehow I. have a great App, I’m sure your web site or App is great, but make sure it fits into that market. Be aware of different expectations, very important point, find out what people expect, what they expect to see. So they can understand it easily. Of make it look and work right. Kind of connects to the point before, that’s just like more to design side ‑‑ test it.
can’t say that often enough. Absolutely test it before you launch. Of and this is the thing I want you to take phloem today, if you forget everything else I said, that’s fine, just put it somewhere in the back of your head, remember, do not make assumptions, assumptions are evil, go there and figure out what the facts are, do your research, two not just make up things even if it might seem logical. And, yeah, that’s what makes a difference if you want to be successful and launch your product in a culturally different market. So, I promise I’m not evil, so you can ask me a couple of questions now.  I think we still have a couple of minutes time, you can contact me on Twitter, this is my GitHub handle, thank you for coming here so early and listening to my talk. (Applause) do we still have time for questions?
Couple of minutes. You can talk to me late for you can’t come up with any right now. No one in okay, cool, thank you (Applause)</p>
